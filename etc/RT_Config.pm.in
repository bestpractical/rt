# $rtname the string that RT will look for in mail messages to
# figure out what ticket a new piece of mail belongs to

# Your domain name is recommended, so as not to pollute the namespace.
# once you start using a given tag, you should probably never change it.
# (otherwise, mail for existing tickets won't get put in the right place

Set($rtname , "example.com");

# You should set this to your organization's DNS domain. For example,
# fsck.com or asylum.arkham.ma.us. It's used by the linking interface to
# guarantee that ticket URIs are unique and easy to construct.

Set($Organization , "example.com");

# $user_passwd_min defines the minimum length for user passwords. Setting
# it to 0 disables this check

# {{{ Incoming mail gateway configuration

# OwnerEmail is the address of a human who manages RT. RT will send
# errors generated by the mail gateway to this address.  This address
# should _not_ be an address that's managed by your RT instance.

Set($OwnerEmail , 'root');

# If $LoopsToRTOwner is defined, RT will send mail that it believes
# might be a loop to $RT::OwnerEmail

Set($LoopsToRTOwner , 1);

# If $StoreLoopss is defined, RT will record messages that it believes
# to be part of mail loops.
# As it does this, it will try to be careful not to send mail to the
# sender of these messages

# $MaxAttachmentSize sets the maximum size (in bytes) of attachments stored
# in the database.

# For mysql and oracle, we set this size at 10 megabytes.

# If $ParseNewMessageForTicketCcs is true, RT will attempt to divine
# Ticket 'Cc' watchers from the To and Cc lines of incoming messages
# Be forewarned that if you have _any_ addresses which forward mail to
# RT automatically and you enable this option without modifying
# "RTAddressRegexp" below, you will get yourself into a heap of trouble.

# incoming email addresses.  In its simplest form,
# you can substitute the value in CanonicalizeEmailAddressReplace

# message to $RTOwner.
#
# If you are not using $LookupSenderInExternalDatabase, this option
# has no effect.

# If you define an AutoRejectRequest template, RT will use this
# template for the rejection message.

# with it will get to the right place automatically.

# and comment mail tracked by RT, unless overridden by a queue-specific
# address.

#Sendmail Configuration

# $MailCommand defines which method RT will use to try to send mail
# We know that 'sendmailpipe' works fairly well.
# If 'sendmailpipe' doesn't work well for you, try 'sendmail'
#
# Note that you should remove the '-t' from $SendmailArguments
# if you use 'sendmail rather than 'sendmailpipe'

Set($MailCommand , 'sendmailpipe');

# $SendmailArguments defines what flags to pass to $Sendmail
# assuming you picked 'sendmail' or 'sendmailpipe' as the $MailCommand above.
# If you picked 'sendmailpipe', you MUST add a -t flag to $SendmailArguments

# to your sendmail binary in $SendmailPath.

# Ccs or AdminCcs (rather than having a blank 'To:' header.

# This feature DOES NOT WORK WITH SENDMAIL[tm] BRAND SENDMAIL
# If you are using sendmail, rather than postfix, qmail, exim or some other MTA,
# you _must_ disable this option.
