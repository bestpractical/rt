# {{{ Base Configuration

# $rtname is the string that RT will look for in mail messages to
# figure out what ticket a new piece of mail belongs to

# Your domain name is recommended, so as not to pollute the namespace.
# once you start using a given tag, you should probably never change it.
# (otherwise, mail for existing tickets won't get put in the right place

Set($rtname , "example.com");


# This regexp controls what subject tags RT recognizes as its own.
# If you're not dealing with historical $rtname values, you'll likely
# never have to enable this feature.
#
# Be VERY CAREFUL with it. Note that it overrides $rtname for subject
# token matching and that you should use only "non-capturing" parenthesis
# grouping. For example:
#
# 	Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/(?:example.com|example.org)/i );
#
# and NOT
# 
# 	Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/(example.com|example.org)/i );
#
# This setting would make RT behave exactly as it does without the 
# setting enabled.
#
# Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/\Q$rtname\E/i );



# You should set this to your organization's DNS domain. For example,
# fsck.com or asylum.arkham.ma.us. It's used by the linking interface to
# guarantee that ticket URIs are unique and easy to construct.

Set($Organization , "example.com");

# $user_passwd_min defines the minimum length for user passwords. Setting
# it to 0 disables this check
Set($MinimumPasswordLength , "5");

# $Timezone is used to convert times entered by users into GMT and back again
# It should be set to a timezone recognized by your local unix box.

# to be part of mail loops.
# As it does this, it will try to be careful not to send mail to the
# sender of these messages

# $MaxAttachmentSize sets the maximum size (in bytes) of attachments stored
# in the database.

# For mysql and oracle, we set this size at 10 megabytes.
# If you're running a postgres version earlier than 7.1, you will need

# $DropLongAttachments: if this is set to a non-undef value,
# RT will silently drop attachments longer than MaxAttachmentSize.

# If $ParseNewMessageForTicketCcs is true, RT will attempt to divine
# Ticket 'Cc' watchers from the To and Cc lines of incoming messages
# Be forewarned that if you have _any_ addresses which forward mail to
# RT automatically and you enable this option without modifying
# "RTAddressRegexp" below, you will get yourself into a heap of trouble.

# incoming email addresses.  In its simplest form,

# message to $RTOwner.
#
# If you are not using $LookupSenderInExternalDatabase, this option

# We know that 'sendmailpipe' works fairly well.

# Note that you should remove the '-t' from $SendmailArguments
