# {{{ Base Configuration

# $rtname is the string that RT will look for in mail messages to
# figure out what ticket a new piece of mail belongs to

# Your domain name is recommended, so as not to pollute the namespace.
# once you start using a given tag, you should probably never change it.
# (otherwise, mail for existing tickets won't get put in the right place

Set($rtname , "example.com");


# This regexp controls what subject tags RT recognizes as its own.
# If you're not dealing with historical $rtname values, you'll likely
# never have to enable this feature.
#
# Be VERY CAREFUL with it. Note that it overrides $rtname for subject
# token matching and that you should use only "non-capturing" parenthesis
# grouping. For example:
#
# 	Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/(?:example.com|example.org)/i );
#
# and NOT
# 
# 	Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/(example.com|example.org)/i );
#
# This setting would make RT behave exactly as it does without the 
# setting enabled.
#
# Set($EmailSubjectTagRegex, qr/\Q$rtname\E/i );



# You should set this to your organization's DNS domain. For example,
# fsck.com or asylum.arkham.ma.us. It's used by the linking interface to
# guarantee that ticket URIs are unique and easy to construct.

Set($Organization , "example.com");

# $user_passwd_min defines the minimum length for user passwords. Setting
# it to 0 disables this check
Set($MinimumPasswordLength , "5");

# $Timezone is used to convert times entered by users into GMT and back again
# It should be set to a timezone recognized by your local unix box.
