#	Set this to point to the directory where you unpacked this
#	distribution, or wherever you want httpd to have its "home"
#
ServerRoot	%%HTTPD_ROOT%%

#
#	The default port for HTTP is 80; if you are not root you have
#	to use a port above 1024; good defaults are 8000, 8001, 8080
#
Port	%%HTTPD_PORT%%

#
#	General setup; on some systems, like HP, nobody is defined so
#	that setuid() fails; in those cases use a different user id.
#
UserId	%%RTUSER%%
GroupId	%%RTGROUP%%

#
#	Logging; if you want logging uncomment these lines and specify
#	locations for your access and error logs
#
AccessLog	 %%HTTPD_ACCESS_LOG%%
ErrorLog	%%HTTPD_ERROR_LOG%%
LogFormat	Common
LogTime		LocalTime

#
#	User-supported directories under ~/public_html
#
UserDir

#
#	Scripts; URLs starting with /cgi-bin/ will be understood as
#	script calls in the directory /your/script/directory
#
Exec	/rt/*	%%RT_CGI_PATH%%/*

#
#	URL translation rules; If your documents are under /local/Web
#	then this single rule does the job:
#
Pass	/webrt/*	%%HTTPD_IMAGES_PATH%%/*
