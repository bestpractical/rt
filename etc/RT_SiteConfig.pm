# The converse is also true, if this file isn't valid perl, you're
# going to run into trouble. To check your SiteConfig file, use
# this command:
#
#   perl -c /path/to/your/etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm
#
# You must restart your webserver after making changes to this file.

# You may also split settings into separate files under the etc/RT_SiteConfig.d/
# directory.  All files ending in ".pm" will be parsed, in alphabetical order,
# after this file is loaded.
