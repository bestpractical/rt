=head1 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Support in RT

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new set of regulations passed by the European
Union taking effect on 25 May 2018. You can read more about the new regulations on
the L<GDPR website|https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection_en>.

Many of these regulations fall to the web site owner or provider of a service, so they are outside
the scope of a software solution. However, RT provides some features that make
compliance easier for organizations who run RT, whatever your internal GDPR policies
might be.

=head1 Viewing User Data in RT

One of the GDPR provisions asserts a "right of access" for users, meaning they can request
access to the personal data an organization has stored for them. Core user data in RT, like
name and email address, are typically stored on a user record.
There are different options to manage how different classes of RT users can view
and even edit their user information.

=head2 Privileged Users

Privileged users in RT are typically the staff of an organization, so they likely have access
to their information in RT. If given the ModifySelf right, Privileged users can
see and modify their full user record at Logged in as > Settings > About Me.

=head2 Unprivileged Users

Unprivileged users will interact with RT via the Self Service interface or through email only.
These users are typically customers and will have much less default access in RT. Since there
are many different relationships with end users, RT offers several different options to
allow Self Service users to view and edit their user data. All of the options below also
require the users to have the ModifySelf right.

L<RT_Config/SelfServiceUserPrefs> has the following options:

=over

=item C<edit-prefs> (default)

When set to C<edit-prefs>, self service users will be able to update
their Timezone and Language preference and update their password.
This is the default behavior of RT.

=item C<view-info>

When set to C<view-info>, users will have full access to all their
user information stored in RT on a read-only page.

=item C<edit-prefs-view-info>

When set to C<edit-prefs-view-info>, users will have full access as in
the C<view-info> option, but also will be able to update their Language
and password as in the default C<edit-prefs> option.

=item C<full-edit>

When set to C<full-edit>, users will be able to fully view and update
all of their stored RT user information.

=head1 Downloading User Data

To provide RT administrators a way to give end users a copy of their data on
request, RT provides several different options to download user data to format-neutral
tsv files. Access to these downloads are available for admins and can also
be offered through self service.

For RT administrators, user data downloads are available on the user admin
page at Admin > Users > Select > [find a user].

To offer download to users via self service, enable the option
L<RT_Config/SelfServiceDownloadUserData> and grant the ModifySelf right
to unprivileged users.

=head2 Download Core User Data

This option provides a file with basic user information from RT. The
format of the download can be modified by setting L<RT_Config/UserDataResultFormat>.

=head2 Download User Tickets

This option provides a file with ticket summaries for all tickets that have
the selected user as a requestor. The ticket summary file format can be
configured with L<RT_Config/UserTicketDataResultFormat>.

=head2 Download User Transactions

This option provides transaction summaries for all transactions on which the
selected user is the creator. This will typically be all of the correspondence
where they replied back to a ticket, so it contains their part of ticket
conversations. The format can be configured with L<RT_Config/UserTransactionDataResultFormat>.

=head1 Removing User Data

One provision of GDPR gives users the "right to be forgotten" which means they can
request that their data be removed from an organization's system. RT provides several
options to remove data associated with a user. These use the L<RT::Shredder> tool and
links are provided from the user administration page to make removal easier.

=head2 Anonymize User

This option will clear all data on the user record for the current user,
while preserving the user record. The required fields for a user are set
to anonymous values.

This option leaves all tickets intact, but the personal information, like
email address, stored on the user record is removed.

It is important to note that this action will not remove user information
from ticket message bodies or email headers, only data from any RT-based sections like
People. To anonymize ticket data, RT provides a script C<rt-munge-attachments>
which you should also run. It is not linked from the web UI because it can
require a long time to run.

=head2 Replace User Information

This option uses shredder with the replace_relations option to replace the
existing userid with the RT user "Nobody" in transactions and other records
that have the id. The user record is then deleted. This option is likely the
easiest since it automatically handles linked objects in one step.

As with the Anonymize User option, this shredder configuration does not find
references to email address or other data in the body of correspondence.
RT provides a script C<rt-munge-attachments> which you should also run to replace
or remove these references.

To replace with a user other than Nobody, update the replace_relations argument
on the shredder page before running.

=head2 Remove User Information

This option uses shredder to remove the user record by running shredder
it without the replace option. Note that this option will fail unless if it
finds remaining references to the user. For example, if the user is a requestor
on a ticket and the ticket is still in the system, the user will still be connected
to the ticket, transactions on the ticket, etc.

To resolve this, you can use other shredder plugins to first remove the other
associated objects. For tickets, for example, you could run a search for
"RequestorEmail = 'user1@example.com'" and then shred the tickets returned.
Once the associated objects are shredded, you can try shredding the user again.
See L<RT::Shredder> for information on plugins for other objects.
