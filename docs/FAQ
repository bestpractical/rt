                      RT Frequently Asked Questions
                                       
------------------------------

Subject: Introduction

   This is the RT Frequently Asked Questions list.
   
   RT is an automated system for monitoring, answering, and
   documenting requests. It was designed as a system to aid helpdesks,
   but could conceivably work just as well for development teams,
   construction groups, political insurgencies, or circus performers
   -- in short, any situation in which a particular group of people
   needs to request information or action from another group of
   people, while monitoring the status of these requests.

   RT was developed by Jesse Vincent <jesse@fsck.com> and he remains
   the primary maintainer aided and abetted by the members of the
   rt-devel mailing list. Development of RT has been sponsored in part
   by Utopia Inc, by The Leftbank Operation and by Wesleyan
   University. Some of the RT code has been derived from Remy Evard's
   req package.

   unless otherwise attributed :-) Special thanks to Jesse, Tobias,
   Charlie and the rt-devel mailing list for their contributions.

                                1. Introduction
                                       
------------------------------

Subject: Q1.1 What is the latest version of RT?

   The latest stable version is 0.99.9 which was released on the 4th
   of August 1999.

   The latest alpha version of RT is 1.0.0pre2 which was released on
   the 1st of October 1999

   This is a beta release leading up to the release of RT 1.0 which
   should come out any day now.

------------------------------

Subject: Q1.2 Where do I get RT?

   The latest released version of RT can be found at
   ftp://ftp.fsck.com/pub/rt/devel/rt.tar.gz

   You will occasionally find alpha releases in the same
   directory. You should not use these unless you are on the rt-devel
   mailing list (rt-devel@fsck.com)

------------------------------

                                2. Installation
                                       
------------------------------

Subject: Q2.1 What other packages/modules are required?

   You will need the following packages to install and run RT
   successfully. The download URL for some of these resources can
   change frequently. If it doesn't work, go to the general URL and
   navigate to the version you require.

	 * Perl version 5.003 or higher
	   General URL : http://www.perl.com/CPAN/
	   Download URL: http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/stable.tar.gz
	   Mirrors     : (should be automatic, but you can try
	                  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/SITES.html)

	 * MySQL 3.20.x, 3.21.x or 3.22.x
	   General URL : http://www.mysql.com
	   Download URL: http://www.mysql.com/download.html
	   Mirrors     : http://www.mysql.com/mirrors.html
        
	 * GNU Make ( http://www.gnu.org )
	 
	   General URL : http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html
	   Download URL: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/
	   Mirrors     : http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html

	   I know for sure that GNU Make supports the conditionals
	   syntax RT's Makefile uses. I can't be sure about anything
	   else.  If you don't have GNU Make, but feel reasonably
	   comfortable with Makefiles, you probably can get by without
	   it.

	 You will need the following Perl packages, all available from
	 CPAN:

	 * Msql-Mysql-modules

	   Download URL: http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Msql/

	   When installing Msql-Mysql-modules, it is imperative that you
	   say yes when asked "Do you want to install the MysqlPerl
	   emulation?"  Please note that Msql-Mysql-modules requires DBD
	   to be installed to function.  See the Msql-Mysql-modules
	   documentation for more information.

	 * CGI.pm

	   Download URL: http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/
	
	   CGI.pm and CGI::Cookie are used for our basic Form and
	   Cookie processing. We recommend that you use at least 2.53
	   as we know that version wokrs.

	 * Digest::MD5

	   Download URL: http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MD5/
	
	   Digest::MD5 is a perl module used for generating MD5 hashes
	   of files or strings, in this case, the password hashes used
	   by the Web interface. It is required for web authentication
	   to work.

------------------------------

Subject: Q2.2 Upgrading from RT version 0.9.1 or lower.

	Since RT 0.9.1, the codebase and database format have undergone
	incompatible changes.  This version of the installation package
	does NOT come with an easy upgrade path from 0.9.1 or before.
	However, the instructions below should make the upgrade possible.
	
	This version of RT should be significantly more stable than 0.9.1,
	but new buglets may have crept into my code when I wasn't looking.
	As always, I look forward to any comments you may have.
	
			Jesse
			jrvincent@wesleyan.edu
	
	
	To upgrade from .9.1 to a post-.9.4 version :

    	"mysqldump -c -t rt > (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE)"  
    	edit (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE) to remove the ACL line for "root"
    		(Something like 
    		 grep -v "INSERT INTO users VALUES ('root'" \
    			(YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE) > (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE2)
    		 should do the trick
    	
    	copy your current RT installation to a safe location
    		"mysqladmin drop rt"    
    	install a fresh copy of RT .9.8, as if for the first time
    	mysql rt < (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE2)
    	copy your transaction tree back into place
    	copy rt/etc/templates/queues back into place

------------------------------

Subject: Q2.3 How do I get a clean RT installation?

    While you are installing and testing RT, you may end up with a lot
    of test transactions cluttering up the database. If you would like
    to clear them out, the following should do the trick (from Bryan
    Allbery allbery@ece.cmu.edu):

    Run mysql, connect to the MySQL database, and delete everything in the
    each_req and transaction tables.

    Then remove everything under the transactions directory wherever
    you installed RT (/usr/local/rt/transactions in my case).

------------------------------

                                3. Request Manipulation
                                       
------------------------------

Subject: Q3.1 How do I access the database directly?

    Mysql has a command line interface. Log onto the database host and
    enter the following command, substituting symbols in ALL CAPS for
    those specified in the Makefile (or in etc/config.pm) where
    appropriate:

	mysql -u <MYSQL_DBADMIN> -p -h <RT_MYSQL_HOST> rt

    Enter the password at the prompt. The password is the one
    specified as RT_MYSQL_PASS in the Makefile.

    You should see a prompt similar to this:

Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4985 to server version: 3.22.23b

Type 'help' for help.

mysql> 

    You can then access the database using SQL commands. Enter "help"
    to get a summary of the available commands. For example, to see
    all RT users, enter "select * from users;" and you should see
    something like the following (the output has been edited, removing
    columns to fit inside 80 characters - missing fields are password,
    email, phone, office and comments):

+----------+-----------------------+-----+----------+
| user_id  | real_name             | ... | admin_rt |
+----------+-----------------------+-----+----------+
| testuser | RT test user          | ... |        0 |
| charlieb | Charlie Brady         | ... |        1 |
| chris    | Chris Maltby          | ... |        0 |
| mbrader  | Michael Brader        | ... |        1 |
+----------+-----------------------+-----+----------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)

------------------------------

                                4. Web Interface
                                       
------------------------------

Subject: Q4.1 When I use webrt, it comes up with "You are not logged in"
or "No valid RT credentials found". What's going on?

    Until you are successfully authenticated, this message and a login
    box are displayed. Enter your RT username and password and click
    OK.

    If you still can't log in, you (or your administrator) will have
    to check whether you are in the database of users and that your
    password is correct.

    The most common problems with authentication are:

    1) User have turned off cookies.

    2) MSIE bug

    3) You're not using the right domain name (i.e.
    <URL:http://skylight.fsck.com/rt/webrt.cgi> gives same behaviour
    while <URL:http://www.fsck.com/rt/webrt.cgi> doesn't)

    4) The cookie is based at several things, also the IP people are
    sitting at - sites using IP masquerading and similar stuff might
    get the broken authentication.

------------------------------

Subject: Q4.2 How do I merge two requests from the web interface?

    Select the request you would like to merge into another
    request. Click on "Serial number", enter the serial number of
    the second request and click on the merge button.

------------------------------

                                5. Mail
                                       
------------------------------

Subject: Q5.1 Sendmail won't let me run rt-mailgate

    If you get an error like the following:

    ----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
|"/usr/local/rt/bin/rt-mailgate general action"
     (expanded from: <rt-action@mustang.hiwaay.net>)

    ----- Transcript of session follows -----
sh: rt-mailgate not available for sendmail programs
554 |"/usr/local/rt/bin/rt-mailgate general action"... Service unavailable

    the following information from Jesse should help:

Sendmail has a program called smrsh. smrsh restricts what binaries can
be run from sendmail aliases.  I think it keeps the programs in
/etc/smrsh on redhat6.  add a symlink from
/usr/local/rt/bin/rt-mailgate to /etc/smrsh/rt-mailgate and things
should work better.

------------------------------

Subject: Q5.2 Why are mail messages being split in two?

Older versions of RT (before 0.99.9) has a bug where lines beginning
with 'From' were not being correctly escaped. You should upgrade to
the latest version of RT.

------------------------------

                                9. Miscellaneous
                                       
------------------------------

Subject: Q9.1 Are there any newsgroups for discussing RT. Mailing lists?

    Currently, there are no newsgroups but there are several mailing lists:

          * rt-users - for users or administrators of RT

	    To subscribe, send mail to rt-users-request@fsck.com with
	    a body containing the word

	      subscribe

	    To unsubscribe, send mail to rt-users-request@fsck.com
	    with a body containing the word

	      unsubscribe

	  * rt-devel - for those who wish to develop RT or understand
	    its internal implementation.

	    As for rt-users but using the address rt-devel-request@fsck.com

------------------------------

Subject: Q9.2 My problem is not in the FAQ. What now?

    If you're still having problems, I suggest the following steps:

    o Ensure you are running the latest copy of RT

    o Make sure that the Perl libraries you are using are the versions
      specified in the INSTALL file

    o send mail to rt-users@lists.fsck.com detailing your problem. You
      should include:

	- the version of RT you are running (the output of the `rt`
	command is sufficient)

	- a description of the system you are running RT on (the
	output of `uname -a`)

	- the version of Perl you are using (the output of `perl -V`)

	- the name and version of your web server software and the
	name and version of any browsers which are being used (if the
	problem relates to the web interface)

	- any local or contributed patches that have been installed
	should be mentioned.

	- the nature of the problem, including detailed steps on how
	to reproduce it.

------------------------------

Subject: Q9.3 Why did Jesse write RT?

          Jesse began RT at the urgings of a coworker while working for
          the summer for Utopia, Inc, and continued work while attending
          Wesleyan University and working for Cohesive Network Systems'
          New England Division (at the time, the LeftBank Operation). All
          three groups have benefitted from it, and hoped to share these
          benefits with the user community at large by keeping Jesse fed
          and amused while working.
          
------------------------------

Subject: Q9.4 Who has helped or sponsored the development of RT?

	  From Jesse:

	  A lot of people are responsible for making RT a better
	  program.  Many thanks to Lauren Burka, who originally tasked
	  me with writing this beast.  She forced me to use a database
	  backend.  I've thanked her for it every day since.  Rich
	  West rewrote this readme and did some UI hacking.  Adam
	  Hirsch, Kit Kraysha, Robin Garner, Jens Glaser, John Adams,
	  Trey Belew, Sean Dague, Nathan Mehl, Kee Hinckley, Rich
	  West, Dale Bewley, Serge Zhuk, Gerald Abshez, Dave Hull,
	  Dave Schenet Dave Walton, Jan Okrouhly, Tobias Brox Lamont
	  Lucase and Charlie Brady have all contributed bug reports,
	  code or ideas that have helped RT along.
	  
	  Arepa, Inc., Utopia Inc, Wesleyan University and The
	  Leftbank Operation have paid me to update RT and release it
	  to the public.  Without their support RT would not exist.
	  If I've left you out, please drop me a line ....it wasn't
	  intentional.
	   
		  Enjoy
