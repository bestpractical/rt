_*This is a design document for a work in progress.
It describes features that do not exist today and may never exist*_

== Text description

* The user of PurchaseOrder queue fill in a numeric "CF", called "Price".
* On creation, it needs to create following approvals:
** "ManagerApproval" if CF.Price is > 1000
** "PresidentApproval" if CF.Price is > 2000
* When all of "M", "P" are resolved (or if there were none to begin with), Create "FinanceApproval".
* If any approvals above is rejected, reject the original ticket.
* If "FinanceApproval" is resolved, resolve original ticket.
* If "FinanceApproval" is rejected, create an approval for "CEOApproval".

== Another Text description

* I have a MonitoredQueue that sets tickets to "Monitored" if its subject matches /monitored/.
* I want to have a kind of Ticket that are 'Monitored'.
* I want all monitored tickets, when they are overdue for 14 days, to:
** Send notification to manager
** Mark as stalled
* I want all monitored tickets, when they are overdue for 28 days, to:
** Mark as rejected
* I want to query all tickets that are monitored as such
* I want to modify 14 => 15 and have it affect all existing tickets that are monitored
* I want to add a new "overdue for 27 days, add a 'ultimatum' correspondence to it" rule
** For all monitored tickets.
* I want to add a new "overdue for 27 days, add a 'ultimatum' correspondence to it" rule
** For all _new_ monitored tickets.
** Without affecting existing ones.
