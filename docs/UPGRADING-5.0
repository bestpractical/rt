=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 4.4.0 and greater

The 5.0 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 4.4.0 to 4.4.1) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

See F<devel/docs/UPGRADING-5.0> for internals changes relevant to
extension writers, including deprecated code.

=head2 Upgrading Recommendations

RT now defaults to a database name of rt5 and an installation root of
/opt/rt5.

If you are upgrading, you will likely want to specify that your database is
still named rt4 or even rt3. Alternatively, you could import a backup of your
database as rt5 to conform to the new default, although this isn't required.

Upgrading to RT 5 over an existing RT 4 installation (/opt/rt4) is not
recommended and will almost certainly cause issues. Instead, do a fresh
install into /opt/rt5 (or your custom location) for the code portion of the
upgrade. Then import your existing database and run the database upgrade
steps using make upgrade-database.

We recommend this approach because of the large number of changes to the code
base for this major release. We moved some things to new locations and old
files are not removed as part of the upgrade process. These old files will
still be detected by RT in some cases and will cause issues.

Installing a fresh code base will also allow you to evaluate your local
modifications and configuration changes as you migrate to 5.0. If you have
changes made directly to the RT code, it's a good time to look at the hooks
RT provides for custom code in extensions or in the local directory. See
F<docs/writing_extensions.pod> for more information.

=head2 Database Changes

=over

=item *

For MySQL and MariaDB, the default character set has been updated to utf8mb4
to accommodate more unicode characters including emojis. See F<README.MySQL>
and F<README.MariaDB> for details.

=item *

The Id field in some tables is changed from INT to BIGINT to accommodate
large RT systems that may hit the maximum number of ids. Because this
change touches large RT tables like Transactions and Attachments, this
upgrade step may take a while to run.

You also will need free disk space equal to the size of these tables
while running because MySQL, MariaDB, and Postgres will create a
temporary copy of the table while running. If you don't have sufficient
space, it can cause this step to fail.

=head2 Notable Changes

=over

=item *

System configuration options can now be changed by SuperUsers via the
web UI. File-based configuration options are still loaded. Changes made
via the web UI take precedence over file-based options if both are set.

If you prefer to keep all configuration in files and disable editing in
the web UI, set this option to 0:

    Set($ShowEditSystemConfig, 0);

=item *

The variables which alter the set of HTML elements allowed in HTML
scrubbing have moved; they have been renamed, and are now found under
L<RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber>.

=item *

The articles interface on tickets has been simplified, now showing only
a dropdown for selecting articles. This dropdown converts to an autocomplete
box when the dropdown contains more than C<$DropdownMenuLimit> items.

With this simplified interface, the "hotlist" feature is no longer needed as
all articles in classes applied to a given queue are available in the
dropdown/autocomplete field. To prevent articles in a class from appearing
for a queue, you can unapply the class from that queue.

The upgrade steps remove the hotlist configuration from your RT database
by removing that column from the Articles table. Since the article class
must be applied to a queue for the hotlist items to appear, all articles
should continue to appear in the new interface.

=item *

The updated rich text editor now shows the browser context menu (right-click
menu) by default, so the MessageBoxUseSystemContextMenu configuration option is
no longer needed and has been removed.

=item *

Dashboards previously in the Home menu have been moved to the Reports menu.
The reports previously in the Reports menu are still there, but you can now
edit the Reports menu like the previous Home menu, so you can remove the
default reports if you like.

All other dashboard menu functionality should be the same including editing
your own menu, the global settings, and setting a user's menu from the user
admin page for that user.

=item *

Accessing RT from a mobile device no longer defaults to the mobile-optimized
interface. RT 5.0 is fully responsive so the full UI can be used on mobile
devices. Set the configuration option C<$ShowMobileSite> to true to restore
the previous behavior.

=item *

RT can now run with GnuPG 2.2. On install or upgrade, it requires the updated
version of L<GnuPG::Interface>. C<make testdeps> will test for the correct version.
RT should also still run with GnuPG 1.4.x. It is not supported for GnuPG versions
2.0 or 2.1. On some Linux systems, you may need to add a new repo to get an
updated GnuPG package with some version of 2.2.

=item *

RT search results now allow inline editing of ticket metadata, greatly
improving usability and convenience. Editable fields are now the default
for most ticket fields in search results.

The ticket Owner field sometimes requires extra work to build and can
result in slower page load times, so the default Owner format is
read-only. To enable inline edit for Owner, update your search to use
the format OwnerNameEdit.

If you experience slower page loads with OwnerNameEdit, you can
display Owner as an autocomplete box rather than a dropdown using the
L<AutocompleteOwners|https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/4.4.4/RT_Config.html#AutocompleteOwners>
configuration option. This may also help other areas of RT in addition to
searches.

We are investigating options to improve the underlying queries. Some users have
reported improved performance with the following indexes, at least on Postgres:

   CREATE INDEX ACL2 ON acl (objecttype, objectid);
   CREATE INDEX ACL3 ON acl (principalid, rightname, principaltype);

We are performing testing and looking for additional feedback before adding these
to default RT.

=head2 Extensions Integrated into RT 5

The following extensions are now part of RT 5. If you previously used any as
an extension, you no longer need the extension after upgrading and can
remove the C<Plugin> line from your RT configuration.

Changes you may need to apply if you previously used the extension
are described below.

=over

=item RT::Extension::QuoteSelection

=item RT::Extension::RightsInspector

=item RT::Extension::ConfigInDatabase

If you previously used L<RT::Extension::ConfigInDatabase>
as an extension, run the F<etc/upgrade/upgrade-configurations> utility
after completing all the other upgrade steps from the F<README>. This
will migrate your existing configuration to the new core RT tables.

=item RT::Extension::CustomRole::Visibility

=item RT::Extension::PriorityAsString

If you previously used numbers for priority and would like to continue
to do so, you can set the new C<$EnablePriorityAsString> option to false.
That will disable the new string-based display.

We also now hide Final Priority by default, but if you previously used it
and would like to continue to do so, you can add this to the Custom CSS
section on the Theme editor:

    .FinalPriority, .TicketFinalPriority {
        display: flex;
    }
    .priority div.value .current-value {
        visibility: visible;
    }
    .priority div.value .current-value .FinalPriority {
        display: inline;
    }

If you would like to now use strings for priority like Low, Medium, High,
check the new C<%PriorityAsString> configuration option. RT provides a simple
default setting that may be sufficient. Set new values if you would like
to customize your priority options.

If you were previously using the PriorityAsString extension, you no longer
need the extension installed. The C<%PriorityAsString>> configuration is
simplified and consolidated, so check the documentation for details on
updating your previous configuration.

=item RT::Extension::AssetSQL

The configuration option $AssetSQL_HideSimpleSearch is now $AssetHideSimpleSearch.
The configuration option $AssetSearchFormat is now $AssetSimpleSearchFormat.

See the configuration documentation in L<RT_Config.pm> for new configuration
options added for AssetSQL and the new asset query builder.

=item RT::Extension::LifecycleUI

=item RT::Extension::REST2

=item RT::Authen::Token

If you previously used L<RT::Authen::Token|https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Authen::Token>
as an extension, run the F<etc/upgrade/upgrade-authtokens> utility
after completing all the other upgrade steps from the F<README>. This
will migrate your existing tokens to the new core RT tables.

=head1 UPGRADING FROM 5.0.0 AND EARLIER

=over 4

=item *

The extension C<RT::Extension::FormattedTransaction> was added to core. This
adds a new RT dependency on the perl module L<Text::WordDiff>, so you will be
prompted to install this new module if your system doesn't have it.

=item *

Similar to the note above regarding the Owner field in search results,
custom fields in search results also now have inline edit enabled by default,
allowing you to change values directly in search results.

For heavy search result pages with many columns display or many rows,
page loads may be slower with this inline edit mode enabled. If you don't
need to edit custom field values, you can change search result columns
from C<CustomField.{Foo}> to C<CustomFieldView.{Foo}>. That column will
then load a view-only field which may improve page load speed.

=item *

In the self service interface, the "Search Articles" box in the menu bar previously
was displayed to users who had the global right "ShowArticle". This is now
controlled by a new configuration option C<$SelfServiceShowArticleSearch>. This new
option defaults to off, so if you currently allow self service users to use article search,
enable this option to keep the article search box available.

=item *

System-level saved searches can now be displayed on the RT at a glance page.
Previously some users saw errors like:

    Either you have no rights to view saved search system-SavedSearch-34
    or identifier is incorrect

If you are still seeing that error after updating to RT 5.0.1, edit the page, remove
the saved search, save, then add it back again. After saving again, it should appear
as expected.

=item *

The System Configuration editor (Admin > Tools > System Configuration > Edit)
now uses JSON rather than Perl syntax to represent arrays and hashes.  Be
sure to enter valid JSON if you wish to modify an array- or hash-valued
configuration setting.

"RT at a glance" now uses dashboard as backend, thus users can switch
different homepages very easily. Users who want to customize homepage need
"ModifySelf", "SeeOwnDashboard", "ModifyOwnDashboard" and
"DeleteOwnDashboard" rights granted. "SeeDashboard" is optional but required
if they want to check out system dashboards too.
