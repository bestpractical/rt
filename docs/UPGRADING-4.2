UPGRADING FROM RT 4.0.0 and greater

* The $LogToScreen config setting is now named $LogToSTDERR which better
  describes what the log level controls.  Setting $LogToScreen will still work,
  but an informational notice will be issued on server start telling you about
  the rename.  To avoid this you should set $LogToSTDERR instead.

* $LinkTransactionsRun1Scrip is removed.  If you were relying on this behaviour
  (by setting it to 1), you should adjust your scrips to ignore one of the link
  transactions.
