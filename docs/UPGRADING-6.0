=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 5.0.0 and greater

The 6.0 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 5.0.1 to 5.0.2) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

See F<devel/docs/UPGRADING-6.0> for internals changes relevant to
extension writers, including deprecated code.

=head2 Upgrading Recommendations

RT now defaults to a database name of rt6 and an installation root of
/opt/rt6.

If you are upgrading, you will likely want to specify that your database is
still named rt5 or even rt4. Alternatively, you could import a backup of your
database as rt6 to conform to the new default, although this isn't required.

Upgrading to RT 6 over an existing RT 5 installation (/opt/rt5) is not
recommended and will almost certainly cause issues. Instead, do a fresh
install into /opt/rt6 (or your custom location) for the code portion of the
upgrade. Then import your existing database and run the database upgrade
steps using make upgrade-database.

We recommend this approach because of the large number of changes to the code
base for this major release. We moved some things to new locations and old
files are not removed as part of the upgrade process. These old files will
still be detected by RT in some cases and will cause issues.

Installing a fresh code base will also allow you to evaluate your local
modifications and configuration changes as you migrate to 6.0. If you have
changes made directly to the RT code, it's a good time to look at the hooks
RT provides for custom code in extensions or in the local directory. See
F<docs/writing_extensions.pod> for more information.

=head2 Notable Application Changes

=over

=item *

RT now uses a library called L<htmx|https://htmx.org/>, which makes AJAX
much easier and allows us to completely change the way pages, components,
and widgets load and update in RT. You'll see the difference on just about
every page in RT starting immediately with the home page. This update gives RT
a much more interactive feel and speeds up nearly every interaction.

=item *

RT's sessions have been refactored to be non-blocking to accommodate the change
to C<htmx> noted above. Because different parts of the page can now be loaded
in parallel, sessions needed to be updated to not expect a single page load.

This change should be transparent, but may impact custom code.

=item *

Saved searches can now be configured to automatically refresh, independent of
the page and other portlets. If you currently use the Refresh feature to reload
your entire home page, we recommend disabling that setting and updating saved
search options to refresh instead. The user experience is much nicer, and it
puts less load on your RT server.

=item *

The Quick Create portlet has been updated to use htmx, so it creates tickets
without a full page reload. It also now supports adding custom fields with
configuration, allowing you to add required custom fields. Add custom
fields using the C<%CustomFieldGroupings> option.

=item *

Ticket create, display, and update pages, and asset create and display pages
are now completely configurable using a new feature called Page Layouts.
You can create and save new page layouts, arranging widgets on the page
however you want. You can then apply these configurations to your Queues
and Catalogs on the respective administration pages.

=item *

Because of the new Page Layouts feature, the UseSideBySideLayout configuration
is no longer needed. This option was previously enabled by default and a
two column page layout is available. A page layout called "One Column" is also
available if you had disabled UseSideBySideLayout and prefer a single-column
layout.

This option was also available as a user-level preference and we don't (yet)
have user-level page layouts. If you prefer a single column layout, for now
you can appeal to your RT admin to set up your queues with "One Column" or
something similar.

=item *

Saved searches, dashboards, and dashboard subscriptions have been refactored
to use their own database tables (instead of "Attributes"). Previously removing
them required you to delete them completely, now you can disable them instead.

This also allowed us to create some new pages for seeing and managing
Dashboards and Saved Searches. As a SuperUser, you will now see
Admin > Global > Dashboards/Saved Searches. On the user admin
page, you can see Dashboards and Saved Searches for each user,
and there is a corresponding page for each group as well.

Related rights have also been tweaked:

=over

=item *

SeeSavedSearch/SeeDashboard and AdminSavedSearch/AdminDashboard are to see
and manage *global* saved searches and dashboards.

=item *

SeeGroupSavedSearch/SeeGroupDashboard and
AdminGroupSavedSearch/AdminGroupDashboard are to see and manage *group*
saved searches and dashboards.

=item *

SeeOwnSavedSearch/SeeOwnDashboard and AdminOwnSavedSearch/AdminOwnDashboard
are to see and manage user's *own* saved searches and dashboards.

=back

Since default saved searches (C<My Tickets>, C<Unowned Tickets>, and
C<Bookmarked tickets>) now are plain system saved searches, we grant all
privileged users C<SeeSavedSearch> so they can see these searches as before.

When testing your upgrade, we encourage all users to check access to dashboards
and saved searches to confirm rights are still set correctly. Note that these
rights apply to seeing and accessing just the configured dashboards and
saved searches themselves. Rights to see the contents of the searches,
like tickets and assets, are defined separately and should not be
effected by these changes.

=item *

Simple search (the default search box on the top of the page) now
searches ticket content, subjects, and custom field values when
you enable full-text search indexes.

Full-text search on ticket content has been available in RT since
RT 4.0. However, the default simple search previously
excluded the ticket subject because it interfered with the full-text
index. This is now updated, so default searches now include subject
and the full-text index is still used.

You can now also search in custom field content by default if you
enable full-text search for custom fields. Enabling it is similar to
full-text search for ticket content. If you already have
full-text indexes enabled for ticket content, you can run C<sbin/rt-setup-fulltext-index>
with the C<--cf-only> option to add custom field indexing.

    sbin/rt-setup-fulltext-index --cf-only

Then update your C<%FullTextSearch> configuration according to the output
of above command. See F<docs/full_text_indexing.pod> for details.

As part of these updates, RT 6 removes support for Sphinx indexing on
MySQL. Sphinx support was added before MySQL had native full-text search.
All of the databases supported by RT now have native full-text search
and that is the recommended configuration for full-text indexes.

[Add info about new ticket and asset configuration options here.]

=item *

The following dependent libraries are updated to the new versions listed
below in RT 6. Note that a common change in all javascript libraries and
RT itself is dropping support for Internet Explorer. This has allowed
developers to use newer javascript features and remove old special code
that was just to handle IE-specific behavior.

Dropzone 7.2.0

The new version supports attachment uploads in secure context only, which
is over https or running a developer checkout on localhost. If you need to
run without SSL, you can disable Dropzone in the RT configuration.

=back

=head2 Extensions Integrated into RT 5

The following extensions are now part of RT 5. If you previously used any as
an extension, you no longer need the extension after upgrading and can
remove the C<Plugin> line from your RT configuration.

Changes you may need to apply if you previously used the extension
are described below.

=item RT::Extension::ArticleTemplates

You need to set L<$EnableArticleTemplates|RT_Config/$EnableArticleTemplates>
to 1 to enable it.
