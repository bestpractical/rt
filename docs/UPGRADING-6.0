=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 5.0.0 and greater

The 6.0 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 5.0.1 to 5.0.2) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

See F<devel/docs/UPGRADING-6.0> for internals changes relevant to
extension writers, including deprecated code.

=head2 Upgrading Recommendations

RT now defaults to a database name of rt6 and an installation root of
/opt/rt6.

If you are upgrading, you will likely want to specify that your database is
still named rt5 or even rt4. Alternatively, you could import a backup of your
database as rt6 to conform to the new default, although this isn't required.

Upgrading to RT 6 over an existing RT 5 installation (/opt/rt5) is not
recommended and will almost certainly cause issues. Instead, do a fresh
install into /opt/rt6 (or your custom location) for the code portion of the
upgrade. Then import your existing database and run the database upgrade
steps using make upgrade-database.

We recommend this approach because of the large number of changes to the code
base for this major release. We moved some things to new locations and old
files are not removed as part of the upgrade process. These old files will
still be detected by RT in some cases and will cause issues.

Installing a fresh code base will also allow you to evaluate your local
modifications and configuration changes as you migrate to 6.0. If you have
changes made directly to the RT code, it's a good time to look at the hooks
RT provides for custom code in extensions or in the local directory. See
F<docs/writing_extensions.pod> for more information.

=head2 Notable Application Changes

=over

=item *

RT now uses a library called L<htmx|https://htmx.org/>, which makes AJAX
much easier and allows us to completely change the way pages, components,
and widgets load and update in RT. You'll see the difference on just about
every page in RT starting immediately with the home page. This update gives RT
a much more interactive feel and speeds up nearly every interaction.

=item *

RT's sessions have been refactored to be non-blocking to accommodate the change
to C<htmx> noted above. Because different parts of the page can now be loaded
in parallel, sessions needed to be updated to not expect a single page load.

This change should be transparent, but may impact custom code.

=item *

Saved searches can now be configured to automatically refresh, independent of
the page and other portlets. If you currently use the Refresh feature to reload
your entire home page, we recommend disabling that setting and updating saved
search options to refresh instead. The user experience is much nicer, and it
puts less load on your RT server.

=item *

The Quick Create portlet has been updated to use htmx, so it creates tickets
without a full page reload. It also now supports adding custom fields with
configuration, allowing you to add required custom fields. Add custom
fields using the C<%CustomFieldGroupings> option.

=head2 Extensions Integrated into RT 5

The following extensions are now part of RT 5. If you previously used any as
an extension, you no longer need the extension after upgrading and can
remove the C<Plugin> line from your RT configuration.

Changes you may need to apply if you previously used the extension
are described below.
