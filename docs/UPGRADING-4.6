=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 4.4.0 and greater

The 4.6 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 4.4.0 to 4.4.1) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

See F<devel/docs/UPGRADING-4.6> for internals changes relevant to
extension writers.
