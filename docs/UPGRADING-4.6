=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 4.4.0 and greater

The 4.6 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 4.4.0 to 4.4.1) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

See F<devel/docs/UPGRADING-4.6> for internals changes relevant to
extension writers.

On MySQL and MariaDB, the default character set has been changed from
utf8 to utf8mb4. This provides support for 4-byte characters such as
emojis on tickets. Postgres and Oracle already had support for these
characters and are not effected by this update.

The variables which alter the set of HTML elements allowed in HTML
scrubbing have moved; they have been renamed, and are now found under
L<RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber>.

=item *

The articles interface on tickets has been simplified, now showing only
a dropdown for selecting articles. This dropdown converts to an autocomplete
box when the dropdown contains more than C<$DropdownMenuLimit> items.

With this simplified interface, the "hotlist" feature is no longer needed as
all articles in classes applied to a given queue are available in the
dropdown/autocomplete field. To prevent articles in a class from appearing
for a queue, you can unapply the class from that queue.

The upgrade steps remove the hotlist configuration from your RT database
by removing that column from the Articles table. Since the article class
must be applied to a queue for the hotlist items to appear, all articles
should continue to appear in the new interface.

The updated rich text editor now shows the browser context menu (right-click
menu) by default, so the MessageBoxUseSystemContextMenu configuration option is
no longer needed and has been removed.
