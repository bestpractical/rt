    <h1>RT Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p>This is the RT Frequently Asked Questions list.
    
    <p>RT is an automated system for monitoring, answering, and
    documenting requests. It was designed as a system to aid
    helpdesks, but could conceivably work just as well for development
    teams, construction groups, political insurgencies, or circus
    performers -- in short, any situation in which a particular group
    of people needs to request information or action from another
    group of people, while monitoring the status of these requests.

    <p>RT was developed by Jesse Vincent &lt;jesse@fsck.com&gt; and he
    remains the primary maintainer aided and abetted by the members of
    the rt-devel mailing list. Development of RT has been sponsored in
    part by Utopia Inc, by The Leftbank Operation and by Wesleyan
    University. Some of the RT code has been derived from Remy Evard's
    req package.

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q1.1 What is the latest version of RT?</h3>

    <p>The latest stable version is 0.99.9 which was released on the
    4th of August 1999.

    <p>The latest alpha version of RT is 1.0.0pre2 which was released
    on the 1st of October 1999

    <p>This is a beta release leading up to the release of RT 1.0
    which should come out any day now.

    <hr>

    <h3>Q1.2 Where do I get RT?</h3>

    <p>The latest released version of RT can be found at <a
    href="ftp://ftp.fsck.com/pub/rt/devel/rt.tar.gz">
    ftp://ftp.fsck.com/pub/rt/devel/rt.tar.gz</a>

    <p>You will occasionally find alpha releases in the same
    directory. You should not use these unless you are on the rt-devel
    mailing list (rt-devel@fsck.com)

    <hr>

    <h2>2. Installation</h2>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q2.1 What other packages/modules are required?</h3>

    <p>You will need the following packages to install and run RT
    successfully. The download URL for some of these resources can
    change frequently. If it doesn't work, go to the general URL and
    navigate to the version you require.

    <ul>
      <li>Perl version 5.003 or higher<br>
    General URL : <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/</a><br>
    Download URL: <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/stable.tar.gz">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/src/stable.tar.gz</a><br>
    Mirrors     : (should be automatic, but you can try
    <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/SITES.html">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/SITES.html</a>)
      </li>

      <li>MySQL 3.20.x, 3.21.x or 3.22.x<br>
        General URL : <a href="http://www.mysql.com">http://www.mysql.com</a><br>
        Download URL: <a href="http://www.mysql.com/download.html">http://www.mysql.com/download.html</a><br>
        Mirrors     : <a href="http://www.mysql.com/mirrors.html">http://www.mysql.com/mirrors.html</a>
      </li>
    
      <li>GNU Make ( http://www.gnu.org )<br>
    
        General URL : <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/make/make.html</a><br>
        Download URL: <a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/make/</a><br>
        Mirrors     : <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html</a>

        <p>I know for sure that GNU Make supports the conditionals
        syntax RT's Makefile uses. I can't be sure about anything
        else.  If you don't have GNU Make, but feel reasonably
        comfortable with Makefiles, you probably can get by without
        it.

    </ul>

    <p>You will need the following Perl packages, all available from
    CPAN:

    <ul>
      <li>Msql-Mysql-modules

        <p>Download URL: <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Msql/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/Msql/</a>

        <p>When installing Msql-Mysql-modules, it is imperative that
        you say yes when asked "Do you want to install the MysqlPerl
        emulation?"  Please note that Msql-Mysql-modules requires DBD
        to be installed to function.  See the Msql-Mysql-modules
        documentation for more information.
      </li>

      <li>CGI.pm

        <p>Download URL: <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/CGI/</a>
    
        <p>CGI.pm and CGI::Cookie are used for our basic Form and
        Cookie processing. We recommend that you use at least 2.53 as
        we know that version works.
      </li>

      <li>Digest::MD5

        <p>Download URL: <a href="http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MD5/">http://www.perl.com/CPAN/modules/by-module/MD5/</a>
    
        <p>Digest::MD5 is a perl module used for generating MD5 hashes
        of files or strings, in this case, the password hashes used by
        the Web interface. It is required for web authentication to
        work.
          </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>Q2.2 Upgrading from RT version 0.9.1 or lower.</h3>

    <p>This is the contents of the file README.91UPGRADE which should be part of the release:

      <pre>
Since RT 0.9.1, the codebase and database format have undergone
incompatible changes.  This version of the installation package
does NOT come with an easy upgrade path from 0.9.1 or before.
However, the instructions below should make the upgrade possible.

This version of RT should be significantly more stable than
0.9.1, but new buglets may have crept into my code when I wasn't
looking.  As always, I look forward to any comments you may have.

Jesse
jrvincent@wesleyan.edu

To upgrade from .9.1 to a post-.9.4 version :

"mysqldump -c -t rt &gt; (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE)"  
edit (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE) to remove the ACL line for "root"
(Something like 
grep -v "INSERT INTO users VALUES ('root'" \
(YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE) &gt; (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE2)
should do the trick

copy your current RT installation to a safe location
"mysqladmin drop rt"    
install a fresh copy of RT .9.8, as if for the first time
mysql rt &lt; (YOUR_RT_DUMP_FILE2)
copy your transaction tree back into place
copy rt/etc/templates/queues back into place
    </pre>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q2.3 How do I get a clean RT installation?</h3>

    <p>While you are installing and testing RT, you may end up with a
    lot of test transactions cluttering up the database. If you would
    like to clear them out, the following should do the trick (from
    Bryan Allbery allbery@ece.cmu.edu):

    <p>Run mysql, connect to the MySQL database, and delete everything
    in the each_req and transaction tables.

    <p>Then remove everything under the transactions directory
    wherever you installed RT (/usr/local/rt/transactions in my case).

    <hr>

    <h2>3. Request Manipulation</h2>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q3.1 How do I access the database directly?</h3>

    <p>Mysql has a command line interface. Log onto the database host
    and enter the following command, substituting symbols in ALL CAPS
    for those specified in the Makefile (or in etc/config.pm) where
    appropriate:

    <pre>
mysql -u &lt;MYSQL_DBADMIN&gt; -p -h &lt;RT_MYSQL_HOST&gt; rt
    </pre>

    <p>Enter the password at the prompt. The password is the one
    specified as RT_MYSQL_PASS in the Makefile.

    <p>You should see a prompt similar to this:

      <pre>
Reading table information for completion of table and column names
You can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with -A

Welcome to the MySQL monitor.  Commands end with ; or \g.
Your MySQL connection id is 4985 to server version: 3.22.23b

Type 'help' for help.

mysql&gt;
    </pre>

    <p>You can then access the database using SQL commands. Enter
    "help" to get a summary of the available commands. For example, to
    see all RT users, enter "select * from users;" and you should see
    something like the following (the output has been edited, removing
    columns to fit inside 80 characters - missing fields are password,
    email, phone, office and comments):

    <pre>
+----------+-----------------------+-----+----------+
| user_id  | real_name             | ... | admin_rt |
+----------+-----------------------+-----+----------+
| testuser | RT test user          | ... |        0 |
| charlieb | Charlie Brady         | ... |        1 |
| chris    | Chris Maltby          | ... |        0 |
| mbrader  | Michael Brader        | ... |        1 |
+----------+-----------------------+-----+----------+
4 rows in set (0.01 sec)
    </pre>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Web Interface</h2>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q4.1 When I use webrt, it comes up with "You are not logged in"
      or "No valid RT credentials found". What's going on?</h3>

    <p>Until you are successfully authenticated, this message and a
    login box are displayed. Enter your RT username and password and
    click OK.

    <p>If you still can't log in, you (or your administrator) will
    have to check whether you are in the database of users and that
    your password is correct.

    <p>The most common problems with authentication are:

    <ol>
      <li>User have turned off cookies.</li>

      <li>MSIE bug</li>

      <li>You're not using the right domain name (i.e.
      &lt;URL:http://skylight.fsck.com/rt/webrt.cgi&gt; gives same
      behaviour while &lt;URL:http://www.fsck.com/rt/webrt.cgi&gt;
      doesn't)</li>

      <li>The cookie is based at several things, also the IP people
      are sitting at - sites using IP masquerading and similar stuff
      might get the broken authentication.</li>

    </ol>

    <hr>

    <h3>Q4.2 How do I merge two requests from the web interface?</h3>

    <p>Select the request you would like to merge into another
    request. Click on "Serial number", enter the serial number of the
    second request and click on the merge button.

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Mail</h2>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q5.1 Sendmail won't let me run rt-mailgate</h3>

    <p>If you get an error like the following:

    <pre>
----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
|"/usr/local/rt/bin/rt-mailgate general action"
(expanded from: &lt;rt-action@mustang.hiwaay.net&gt;)

----- Transcript of session follows -----
sh: rt-mailgate not available for sendmail programs
554 |"/usr/local/rt/bin/rt-mailgate general action"... Service unavailable
    </pre>

    <p>then, the following information from Jesse should help:

    <pre>
Sendmail has a program called smrsh. smrsh restricts what binaries can
be run from sendmail aliases.  I think it keeps the programs in
/etc/smrsh on redhat6.  add a symlink from
/usr/local/rt/bin/rt-mailgate to /etc/smrsh/rt-mailgate and things
should work better.
    </pre>

    <hr>

    <h3>Q5.2 Why are mail messages being split in two?</h3>

    <p>Older versions of RT (before 0.99.9) has a bug where lines
    beginning with 'From' were not being correctly escaped. You should
    upgrade to the latest version of RT.

    <hr>

    <h2>9. Miscellaneous</h2>
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q9.1 Are there any newsgroups for discussing RT. Mailing lists?</h3>

    <p>Currently, there are no newsgroups but there are several
    mailing lists:

    <ul>
      <li>rt-users - for users or administrators of RT

        <p>To subscribe, send mail to rt-users-request@fsck.com with a
          body containing the word

        <pre>
subscribe
        </pre>

        <p>To unsubscribe, send mail to rt-users-request@fsck.com with
        a body containing the word

        <pre>
unsubscribe
        </pre>
      </li>

      <li>rt-devel - for those who wish to develop RT or understand
      its internal implementation.

        <p>To subscribe/unsubscribe, follow the instructions for
        rt-users but using the address rt-devel-request@fsck.com

      </li>
    </ul>
      
    <hr>

    <h3>Q9.2 My problem is not in the FAQ. What now?</h3>

    <p>If you're still having problems, I suggest the following steps:

    <ul>

      <li>Ensure you are running the latest copy of RT</li>

      <li>Make sure that the Perl libraries you are using are the
      versions specified in the INSTALL file</li>

    <li>send mail to rt-users@lists.fsck.com detailing your
    problem. You should include:

        <p>
        <ul>
          <li>the version of RT you are running (the output of the
          `rt` command is sufficient)</li>

          <li>a description of the system you are running RT on (the
          output of `uname -a`)</li>

          <li>the version of Perl you are using (the output of `perl
          -V`)</li>

          <li>the name and version of your web server software and the
          name and version of any browsers which are being used (if
          the problem relates to the web interface)</li>

          <li>any local or contributed patches that have been
          installed should be mentioned.</li>

          <li>the nature of the problem, including detailed steps on
          how to reproduce it.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <hr>

    <h3>Q9.3 Why did Jesse write RT?</h3>

    <p>Jesse began RT at the urgings of a coworker while working for
    the summer for Utopia, Inc, and continued work while attending
    Wesleyan University and working for Cohesive Network Systems' New
    England Division (at the time, the LeftBank Operation). All three
    groups have benefitted from it, and hoped to share these benefits
    with the user community at large by keeping Jesse fed and amused
    while working.
    
    <hr>

    <h3>Q9.4 Who has helped or sponsored the development of RT?</h3>

    <p>From Jesse:

    <pre>
A lot of people are responsible for making RT a better
program.  Many thanks to Lauren Burka, who originally tasked
me with writing this beast.  She forced me to use a database
backend.  I've thanked her for it every day since.  Rich
West rewrote this readme and did some UI hacking.  Adam
Hirsch, Kit Kraysha, Robin Garner, Jens Glaser, John Adams,
Trey Belew, Sean Dague, Nathan Mehl, Kee Hinckley, Rich
West, Dale Bewley, Serge Zhuk, Gerald Abshez, Dave Hull,
Dave Schenet Dave Walton, Jan Okrouhly, Tobias Brox Lamont
Lucase and Charlie Brady have all contributed bug reports,
code or ideas that have helped RT along.

Arepa, Inc., Utopia Inc, Wesleyan University and The
Leftbank Operation have paid me to update RT and release it
to the public.  Without their support RT would not exist.
If I've left you out, please drop me a line ....it wasn't
intentional.

Enjoy
