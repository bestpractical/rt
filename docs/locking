RT Locking
----------

- A lock can be initiated manually by clicking the "Lock" link on one of the pages for the ticket (hard lock)

- A lock is created whenever a user performs an action on a ticket that takes multiple steps (auto lock) if a 
  hard lock is not already in place for that ticket

- A lock can be removed manually by clicking the "Unlock" link on one of the pages for the ticket (hard unlock)

- An auto lock is removed once the user is done with whatever he was doing on the page (e.g., when he clicks 
  "Save Changes" on the Edit page). It is also removed if the Unlock link is clicked from a page that generated
  an auto lock. Clicking "Unlock" will also remove the hard lock on the ticket, if there is one.

- Locks are advisory: if a ticket is locked by one user, other users will be given a notification (in red) that another user has locked the ticket but they will still be allowed to edit and submit changes on the ticket.

- Locks will remain in place until
	a) The user is done editing/replying/etc. (for auto locks, if there is no hard lock on the ticket)
	b) The user clicks the Unlock link
	c) The user logs out
	d) A configurable expiry period has elapsed

- When a user clicks the "Take" link for an RTIR Incident ticket, a lock is added. This lock is a special case, and will
  be removed when the Incident is linked to a new or existing Investigation.

- When a user locks a ticket (auto lock or hard lock), they are given a notification informing them of their lock (in some other color--currently green).

- When a user unlocks a ticket (auto unlock or hard unlock), they are given a notification informing them that their
  lock has been removed, and how long they had the ticket locked for.

- When a user accesses a page for a ticket that they have locked, they are presented with a notification informing them
  that they have the ticket locked, and how long they have had the ticket locked.

- When a user accesses a page for a ticket that has been locked by another user, they are given a notification of the
  other user's lock, with the locking user's name and how long they have had it locked for.
