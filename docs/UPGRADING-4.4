=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 4.2.0 and greater

The 4.4 release is a major upgrade and as such there are more changes
than in a minor bugfix release (e.g., 4.2.2 to 4.2.3) and some of these
changes are backward-incompatible. The following lists some of the notable
changes, especially those that might require you to change a configuration
option or other setting due to a change in RT. Read this section carefully
before you upgrade and look for changes to features you currently use.

See F<devel/docs/UPGRADING-4.4> for internals changes relevant to
extension writers.

RT now natively supports external authentication systems like
LDAP and custom database setups. For new users wishing to use this
functionality, see the L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth::LDAP> or
L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth::DBI> documentation.

Users of the existing
L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth|https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Authen::ExternalAuth>
extension should remove C<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth> from the plugins list,
and add C<Set($ExternalAuth, 1);> to the F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> file. Please
also remove F<local/plugins/RT-Authen-ExternalAuth> from your RT
installation.

=item *

L<RT::Extension::LDAPImport|https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Extension::LDAPImport>
has been moved into core RT.

Users of the existing LDAPImport extension should remove
C<RT::Extension::LDAPImport> from the plugins list. Please adjust any
cronjobs or external scripts which invoke
F<local/plugins/RT-Extension-LDAPImport/bin/rtldapimport> to instead
invoke F<sbin/rt-ldapimport>. Please also remove
F<local/plugins/RT-Extension-LDAPImport> from your RT installation.

=item *

As of 4.4, the C<RT::Extension::Assets> functionality has been moved to
core RT. New and upgrading users will automatically get all Assets
functionality. Assets documentation can be found at F<docs/assets.pod>.
A tutorial on customizing your Assets install can be found at
F<docs/customizing/assets/tutorial.pod>.

To cleanly hide it from upgrading RT installs, the Assets menu is controlled
by the right ShowAssetsMenu. This right is only grantable globally to groups
or users. If you were previously using the Assets extension, you can grant the
ShowAssetsMenu right to Privileged or another role or group to make the menu
visible.

Users who are currently using the
L<RT::Extension::Assets|https://bestpractical.com/assets/> extension
should remove C<RT::Extension::Assets> from the plugin list and run the
F<etc/upgrade/upgrade-assets> utility after completing all the other
upgrade steps from the F<README>. Please also remove
F<local/plugins/RT-Extension-Assets> from your RT installation.

=item *

SLA tracking is in core now, so C<SLA> became a core field. Please see the SLA
section in F<RT_Config.pm> as well as F<docs/customizing/sla.pod>.

Users who are currently using
L<RT::Extension::SLA|https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Extension::SLA> should
remove C<RT::Extension::SLA> from the plugin list, and run
F<etc/upgrade/upgrade-sla>. Please also remove
F<local/plugins/RT-Extension-SLA> from your RT installation. Note that with
core SLA, all queues share the same set of levels defined in
C<%ServiceAgreements>.

=item *

RT can now natively store attachments outside the database, either on disk, in
Dropbox, or on Amazon S3. For more information see L<RT::ExternalStorage> and
C<%ExternalStorage> in F<RT_Config.pm>.

Users who are currently using
L<RT::Extension::ExternalStorage|https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Extension::ExternalStorage>
should remove it from the plugin list. Please adjust any cronjobs or external
scripts which invoke
F<local/plugins/RT-Extension-ExternalStorage/bin/extract-attachments>
to instead invoke F<sbin/rt-externalize-attachments>. Please also remove
F<local/plugins/RT-Extension-ExternalStorage> from your RT installation.

=item *

RT now has the functionality from L<RT::Extension::ParentTimeWorked> built in.
When a child ticket's TimeWorked field is updated, its parent ticket's
TimeWorked field will also be incremented.

It also has built-in functionality for recording time worked per user.
When a ticket's TimeWorked field is updated, the time will be attributed
to the currently logged in user.

Both of these functions are enabled via scrips. New installs will have these
scrips by default. Upgrades will get them too, but set as disabled so they
don't interfere with your existing configuration. If you would like to enable
either of these functions, enable the 'On TimeWorked Change Update User
TimeWorked' and/or 'On TimeWorked Change Update Parent TimeWorked' scrips. New
deployments have these scrips enabled by default.

Users who are currently using
L<RT::Extension::ParentTimeWorked|https://metacpan.org/pod/RT::Extension::ParentTimeWorked>
should remove it from the plugin list. Please also remove
F<local/plugins/RT-Extension-ParentTimeWorked> from your RT installation.

=item *

The support for C<jsmin> (via the C<$JSMinPath> configuration) has been
removed in favor of a built-in solution.

=item *

You can now split settings from F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> into separate files under
an F<etc/RT_SiteConfig.d/> directory. All files ending in C<.pm> will be
parsed, in alphabetical order, after the main F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> is loaded.

You also no longer need the C<1;> at the end of site config files.

=item *

When creating linked tickets from the Links box, Time Worked, Time
Estimated, and Time Left will no longer be copied.  This simplifies time
reporting.

=item *

Custom fields with categories will be split out into hierarchical custom
fields.

=item *

Homepage component "Quicksearch" has been renamed to "QueueList" to reflect
what it actually is. Please update C<$HomepageComponents> accordingly if you
customized it in F<RT_SiteConfig.pm>.

=item *

RT::Interface::Email no longer exports functions.

=item *

Incoming email now always creates users for the C<From:> address.
Previously, if the C<CreateTicket> right was not granted to C<Everyone>
or C<Unprivileged>, the email would be rejected without a user; now, the
user will be created even when the mail is rejected.

=item *

The L<RT_Config/@MailPlugins> functionality has been rewritten; mail
plugins written for previous versions of RT will not function as
expected.  See F<docs/extending/mail_plugins.pod>

=item *

The C<$UnsafeEmailCommands> option has been replaced with two mail
plugins, L<RT::Interface::Email::Action::Take> and
L<RT::Interface::Email::Action::Resolve>.

=item *

The C<RejectOnUnencrypted> option to L<RT_Config/%Crypt> has been
replaced with a mail plugin,
L<RT::Interface::Email::Authz::RequireEncrypted>.

=item *

We added L<DateTime::Format::Natural> support to parse user-entered datetimes,
which will be called only when L<Time::ParseDate> fails to parse. You can tell
RT to prefer L<DateTime::Format::Natural> in F<RT_SiteConfig.pm>:

    Set($PreferDateTimeFormatNatural, 1);

You might do this if you prefer its handling of some syntax (e.g. "last
month").

=item *

The "Display Columns" section in the Search Builder has been ajaxified, so you
don't need to reload the whole page to adjust formatting.

=item *

When corresponding/commenting on tickets, you can include attachments that
already exist on the ticket so you don't need to upload them again.

This functionality was previously provided by the third-party
L<RT::Extension::AddAttachmentsFromTransactions>.

=item *

We added a C<Disabled> column to the Articles table, so now instead of deleting
articles, we disable them, like other RT records. This helps maintain RT's
auditability goals.

For new deploys we also establish some common defaults for Articles: a General
class and a Content textarea custom field.

=item *

We removed the C<InitialPriority>, C<FinalPriority>, and C<DefaultDueIn>
columns from the Queues table. In their stead we have a more general
C<< ->DefaultValue >> call, e.g.

    $queue->DefaultValue('InitialPriority')
    $queue->DefaultValue('FinalPriority')
    $queue->DefaultValue('Due')

Note that "Due" can now be anything that can be parsed as a date.

With this, we've also added the ability to add default values for "Starts" and
custom fields. All of them may be set on a queue's DefaultValues admin page.

=item *

We've added a new config option and preference for C<HideUnsetFieldsOnDisplay>
to hide unset fields on the ticket display page. Note that this option does not
affect custom fields. If you would like to hide custom fields too, please see
L<RT::Extension::CustomField::HideEmptyValues>.

=item *

We've added another option for rendering ticket history: infinite scroll. This
loads several items at a time as you scroll down the page. This should improve
the perceived performance of ticket display. Users can enable this option by
changing the "Show history" preference to "as you scroll". You can also change
the system default in F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> just like the existing options with

    Set($ShowHistory, 'scroll');

=item *

RT now ships with keyboard shortcuts, both global (e.g. C</> to focus on quick
search) and page-specific (e.g. C<x> to toggle a checkbox in bulk update).
Press C<?> in your browser to see what shortcuts can be used on the current
page.

=item *

We added a modern file uploader (Dropzone, L<http://www.dropzonejs.com>). Now
it's much easier to upload multiple files at a time, by dragging them into the
page.

The legacy attachment is still available when the modern uploader fails to
load.

=item *

We added two meta-statuses to TicketSQL: C<__Active__> and C<__Inactive__>, so
you no longer need to explicitly list all the active or inactive statuses like:

    Status = 'new' or Status = 'open' or Status = 'stalled'

Now you can simply write:

    Status = '__Active__'

=item *

We added an "Entry Hint" to custom fields. Previously, we used the custom
field's C<FriendlyType> as its hint, but now it is replaced by the per-CF
customizable C<EntryHint> field.

=item *

RT now has support for custom roles, along the lines of Requestor, Owner, Cc,
and AdminCc. You can select whether a custom role may have only a single member
or multiple members (though you cannot change the role's arity after it's been
created). You can assign custom roles to queues much like custom fields. Rights
may be granted on custom roles globally or per-queue, and they may be searched
in TicketSQL and the search builder with syntax like the following:

    CustomRole.{Engineer}.EmailAddress LIKE 'bestpractical.com'
    CustomRole.{3} = '__CurrentUser__'

Finally you may notify custom roles in scrips by creating a
L<RT::Action::Notify> with an C<Argument> containing the role name or
C<RT::CustomRole-#>. By default, custom roles will be added as Cc on outgoing
mail but you can set them as To or Bcc by using a new slash syntax:

    AdminCc, Engineer
    Owner, RT::CustomRole-3/To, Cc
    Engineer/To, Sales/Bcc

Custom role members can be added at the queue level (for multi-member roles) as
well as on individual tickets (for both single-member and multi-member roles).

=item *

Users can now select which days of the week they'd like Daily dashboard
subscriptions to be mailed to them. This removes the now-duplicate C<M-F>
subscription type and makes the C<Daily> subscription type respect new per-day
checkboxes.

=item *

We've dropped several never-used columns on the C<Users> and C<Tickets> tables
and several columns that haven't been used in a very long time. The first 4.4
upgrade step makes sure there is no content in these fields, just in case an
extension or local customization had appropriated any of them.

For Users, we've dropped C<EmailEncoding>, C<WebEncoding>,
C<ExternalContactInfoId>, C<ContactInfoSystem>, C<ExternalAuthId>,
C<AuthSystem>, and C<PGPKey>. (Note: GPG keys have always been stored in
attributes on the User record in RT, never in the C<PGPKey> column)

For Tickets, we've dropped C<IssueStatement>, C<Resolution>, and C<Disabled>.

=item *

Users now receive a warning message when they type the word "attach" without
having attached anything to the ticket, much like many mail clients offer. This
should help cut down on the "oops, I forgot the attachment" followup mails.

=item *

We've upgraded our version of jQuery from 1.9.1 to 1.11.3 and jQuery UI from
1.10.0 to 1.11.4.

https://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.10/
https://jqueryui.com/upgrade-guide/1.11/

=item *

We've upgraded our version of CKEditor from 4.0.1 to 4.5.3.

=item *

In rights management pages, sections with rights assigned now have a gray
callout.

=item *

We've removed the C<Type> column for Groups, which was redundant. C<Domain>
identifies the type of group.

=item *

We've removed the C<ObjectId> for Principals, which was redundant, as it should
always be the same as C<id>.

=item *

We've added a new config option C<%ReferrerComponents> to customize how
referrer whitelists and blacklists work.

=item *

We now place tmpfiles generated during email parsing under /tmp, which
should allow the system tmp-cleaner to purge any dangling files, and
eases configuration of RT under SELinux.

=item *

Squelching now applies to all updates in the request, instead of only the
initial correspond/comment transaction.

=item *

We removed the unused "on merge" lifecycle property, as merged tickets cannot
be found via searches or charts.

=item *

We now allow ModifyTicket to change nobody to someone else, without OwnTicket.

Previously, we required OwnTicket if the ticket was currently unowned, no
matter if you were taking it yourself or assigning it to someone else.

We now allow nobody -> self with OwnTicket and (ModifyTicket, ReassignTicket,
or TakeTicket), and nobody -> someone else with ModifyTicket or ReassignTicket.
This also closes a bug where TakeTicket and OwnTicket was enough to change the
owner from Nobody to someone else.

=item *

We now no longer large round number of hours worked into days, since "7 days
worked" may imply only 56 business hours instead of 168 real hours.

=item *

We've added a ticket timer feature for automatically keeping track of time.
This feature pops open a small JavaScript window with a very much trimmed down
RT interface.

=item *

On ticket display pages we now make the queue name a hyperlink to a search for
all active tickets in that queue.

=item *

There is a new widget on the ticket display page that allows you to create a
ticket in a different queue that will automatically be linked to the given
ticket. In the Links section on the display page, choose the type of link and
the queue, and click Create. The create ticket form will be opened. When the
ticket is created, it will be linked to the previous ticket.

=item *

IPv6 custom field values are now displayed in compressed form, for clarity.
Searching and updating handle both representations as you'd expect.

=head1 UPGRADING FROM 4.4.0 AND EARLIER

=over 4

=item *

We updated default RT searches that previously specified 'new' and 'open' status
to use the new '__Active__' and '__Inactive__' syntax where appropriate. For new
RT's, this means the default RT at a Glance searches will now work with custom
lifecycles without updating these searches.

For existing RTs, you may want to update the "highest priority tickets I own" and
'newest unowned tickets' system searches to use '__Active__' rather than specific
statuses if you have a custom lifecycle.
