Getting the source for the tom-select JS plugin.

1. Clone the repo from github:

    https://github.com/orchidjs/tom-select.git

2. cd to the base project directory and build the project. This many require installing grunt and other dependencies.

    npm install
    npm run build

This will create a new dist directory.

3. Remove the sourceMappingURL line from the minified JS and CSS file.

The last line in tom-select.bootstrap5.css and tom-select.complete.min.js enables sourceMappingURL.
RT contains all of the source and an un-minified version of the JS, so we don't need to provide
maps files.

4. Copy the following generated files to the RT directories shown.

    cp dist/css/tom-select.bootstrap5.css ~/rt-dir/share/static/css/elevator/
    cp dist/js/tom-select.complete.js ~/rt-dir/devel/third-party/tom-select/
    cp dist/js/tom-select.complete.min.js ~/rt-dir/share/static/js/
