=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 4.4.0 and greater

This documentation notes internals changes between the 4.4 and 5.0
series that are primarily of interest to developers writing extensions
or local customizations.  It is not an exhaustive list.

=item *

The default callback in C<Articles/Elements/IncludeArticle> provides a ticket
object. However, the template itself does not need this ticket object, so it
is no longer guaranteed to be loaded when it is passed.

=item *

New group options were added to the ticket listings pages in SelfService. With
the additions, the C<AfterMyRequests> callback is no longer at the bottom of the
page. If you previously used this callback to add to the bottom of the SelfService
page, a new callback C<AfterMyGroupRequests> is now available below the new group
ticket listing.

=item *

When we cored RT::Extension::ConfigInDatabase, we renamed  the table to
Configurations and also changed the internal implementation to support storing
regex there.

=head1 DEPRECATED CODE

Code that is no longer used after updates is marked as deprecated so it will log
a warning for two versions before we remove it. This gives developers time to
update their code. This section lists code that has been removed after this
period.

=item *

SQLFilter callback in /Elements/QueueSummaryByLifecycle

=item *

AfterUpdateCustomFieldValue callback in share/html/Admin/CustomFields/Modify.html

=item *

share/html/Elements/Quicksearch, which was renamed to QueueList

=item *

The find_expired_rows setting for ObjectCustomFieldValues is now find_disabled_rows.

=item *

RT::Queue now has a SetDefaultValue method, so individual methods for setting/getting defaults
are removed: SetInitialPriority, InitialPriority, SetFinalPriority, FinalPriority,
SetDefaultDueIn, DefaultDueIn.
