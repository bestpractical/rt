=head1 UPGRADING FROM RT 5.0.0 and greater

This documentation notes internals changes between the 5.0 and 6.0
series that are primarily of interest to developers writing extensions
or local customizations.  It is not an exhaustive list.

In RT 6, RT's sessions have been refactored to be non-blocking. To
do this, we needed to change the way RT code interacts with sessions,
mostly when setting values. If you have code that uses sessions,
you will need to make changes.

Previously, C<$session> was a global hash you could access directly
to get or set values for the current logged in user. For example, RT
would set the current user directly in the session hash with code like:

    $HTML::Mason::Commands::session{'CurrentUser'} = RT::CurrentUser->new();

Starting in RT 6, you also need to explicitly call a C<Set> method to
store those updates with code like this:

    # Write changes back to persistent session
    RT::Interface::Web::Session::Set(
        Key   => 'CurrentUser',
        Value => $HTML::Mason::Commands::session{'CurrentUser'},
    );

In addition to C<Set> for setting values, there is a new C<Load> method to
load values and a C<Delete> to clear values out. You an find examples of all
of these in the RT 6 code to see how they are used.

The C<$session> hash is still available globally as previously and can be
accessed directly to get values, so that code does not need to change. This
is likely the most common interaction with the session in extensions and
custom code.

These session updates were needed to work with the new C<htmx> architecture
(see below).

=item *

RT now uses a library called L<htmx|https://htmx.org/>, which makes AJAX
much easier and allows us to completely change the way pages, components,
and widgets load and update in RT. You'll see the difference on just about
every page in RT starting immediately with the home page. This update gives RT
a much more interactive feel and speeds up nearly every interaction.

Much existing code in callbacks should continue to work, but it will require
testing because not all callbacks are called with the same context they had
previously. Many components are now called individually and not in the context
of a full RT page load and this may change the way code runs and html is
rendered in responses.

For new development, we think you'll find C<htmx> to be an exciting and fun
new way to create interactive components in RT. It allows RT to gain all of
the benefits of a single-page javascript application with easy access to AJAX
calls and dynamic page content, while still using the server-side Perl tools
we already know.

=item *

The Quick Create portlet has been updated to use htmx. This means C<index.html>
and C<Render.html> will no longer be reloaded when the create form is
submitted. If you previously used the Initial callback in either of these files,
you can move your logic to the Initial callback in the new /Helpers/QuickCreate
file where ProcessQuickCreate is now called.

The quick create form also had a callback C<InFormElement> inside the opening
C<form> tag. This has been removed because any form-specific attributes added
are unlikely to work with htmx as-is. If you need to modify the form tag,
you can create an overlay and customize there.

=item *

Now you can customize ticket/asset create/update/display pages via
L<RT_Config/%PageLayoutMapping> and some callbacks have been removed because of
the change. If you use these callbacks, you can update your code to use other
existing callbacks or some new callbacks that have been added. For example,
there are now callbacks at the start and end of every widget.

The new design also means you can migrate your code into your own custom widget
and add anywhere using the L<RT_Config/%PageLayoutMapping>.

To make upgrading RT easier, we have ported some of them so they can still
work in RT 6.0, but they may not look like they did in earlier versions.
We strongly recommend that you plan to migrate to the new layout.

Affected callbacks include:

=item /Ticket/Display.html BeforeShowSummary

You can switch to C<BeforeWidget> in C</Elements/ShowWidgetSection>.

=item /Ticket/Display.html BeforeShowHistory

It's been ported to C</Ticket/Widgets/Display/History>, but C<Transactions> and
C<Attachments> arguments are absent. You can switch to C<BeforeWidget>.

=item /Ticket/Create.html AfterOwner

You can switch to C<BeforeCustomFields> in C</Elements/EditCustomFields>.

=item /Ticket/Create.html AfterBasics

You can switch to C<AfterWidget> in C</Ticket/Widgets/Create/Basics>.

=item /Ticket/Create.html BeforeRequestors, AfterRequestors, ModifyCustomRoles, AfterSubject, BeforeMessageBox, and AfterMessageBox

They have been ported to C</Ticket/Widgets/Create/Message> accordingly.

=item /Ticket/Update.html AfterTableOpens, BeforeUpdateType, AfterUpdateType, and AfterWorked

They have been ported to C</Ticket/Widgets/Update/Basics> accordingly.

C<BeforeUpdateType> was incorrectly positioned before C<Queue> item in RT 5,
now it's right above the "Update Type" input. Previously it could be used to
not render the hidden "id" input, now "id" is a mandatory input so you can't
skip it any more.

=item /Ticket/Update.html RightColumnBottom

You can switch to C<AfterWidget> in C</Ticket/Widgets/Update/Basics>.

=item /Ticket/Update.html BeforeScrips and AfterScrips

You can switch to C<BeforeWidget> and C<AfterWidget> in
C</Ticket/Widgets/Update/PreviewScrips>, respectively.

=item /Ticket/Update.html AfterGnuPG, AfterSubject, BeforeMessageBox, and AfterMessageBox

They have been ported to C</Ticket/Widgets/Update/Message> accordingly.

=item /Asset/Display.html AfterShowSummary

You can switch to C<AfterWidget> in C</Elements/ShowWidgetSection>.

=item /Asset/Display.html AfterShowHistory

It's been ported to C</Asset/Widgets/Display/History>, you can switch to
C<AfterWidget>.

=back

Besides, C</Ticket/Elements/ShowSummary> and C</Asset/Elements/ShowSummary> are
not called on display pages any more. If you have a customized version, you will
need to customize corresponding widgets like "/Ticket/Widgets/Display/Basics",
"/Asset/Widgets/Display/Basics", etc.

=head1 DEPRECATED CODE

Code that is no longer used after updates is marked as deprecated so it will log
a warning for two versions before we remove it. This gives developers time to
update their code. This section lists code that has been removed after this
period.
