rt-munge-attachments - Remove or replace strings in attachment records

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    rt-munge-attachments --search="user1@example.com" --replace="removed-user@example.com"

=cut

=head1 DESCRIPTION

In RT, "attachments" contain all correspondence on tickets, not just file-based
attachments. Although attachments are normally not modified by RT once created,
this script provides a way to change or remove personalized data like email
addresses that might be contained in the headers or bodies of RT attachment
records. This allows admins to comply with GDPR regulations, but retain ticket
histories with remaining non-personal information.

A transaction is recorded when this script modifies content so there is a record that
something was changed on the ticket. Details of the change are not recorded since
the values would likely contain personal information which the script was run to
remove.

If modifying ticket history violates audit policies, admins should not use this
script.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over

=item --search=SEARCH

Provide a string to search the header and content columns in the attachments table.
If a match is found the content will be removed unless a replacement is provided.

=item --replace=REPLACEMENT

Provide a string to replace the value matched by the search.

=back
