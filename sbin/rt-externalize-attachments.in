=head1 NAME

rt-externalize-attachments - Move attachments from database to external storage

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    rt-externalize-attachments [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

rt-externalize-attachments is used to move attachments out of the database to
some external storage.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item --age=AGE

If age is given, then only attachments older than C<AGE> days will be moved.
By default everything is moved.

=item --batchsize=NUM

If batchsize is given, then only C<NUM> number of attachments will be moved.
By default everything is moved.

=item -h

=item --help

Display this documentation

=item -v

=item --verbose

Log a message (at level "info") for each attachment, both before its
upload begins and after it completes.

=item --dry-run

Make a trial run and do no changes (mostly the same output as a real run is
produced). C<dry-run> implies verbose output.
