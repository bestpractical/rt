=head1 NAME

extract_pod_tests -  RT-specific variant of pod2tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  pod2test [-Mmodule] [input [output]]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<pod2test> is a front-end for Test::Inline.  It generates the 
"Bodies" of MakeMaker style .t testing files from embedded tests and 
code examples.

If output is not specified, the resulting .t file will go to STDOUT.
Otherwise, it will go to the given output file.  If input is not
given, it will draw from STDIN.

If the given file contains no tests or code examples, no output will
be given and no output file will be created.

=head1 BUGS and CAVEATS

This is a very simple rough cut.  It only does very rudimentary tests
on the examples.
