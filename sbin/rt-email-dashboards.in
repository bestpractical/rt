=head1 NAME

rt-email-dashboards - Send email dashboards

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    rt-email-dashboards [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This tool will send users email based on how they have subscribed to
dashboards. A dashboard is a set of saved searches, the subscription controls
how often that dashboard is sent and how it's displayed.

Each subscription has an hour, and possibly day of week or day of month. These
are taken to be in the user's timezone if available, UTC otherwise.

=head1 SETUP

You'll need to have cron run this script every hour. Here's an example crontab
entry to do this.

    0 * * * * @RT_SBIN_PATH_R@/rt-email-dashboards

This will run the script every hour on the hour. This may need some further
tweaking to be run as the correct user.

=head1 OPTIONS

This tool supports a few options. Most are for debugging.

=over 8

=item -h

=item --help

Display this documentation

=item --dryrun

Figure out which dashboards would be sent, but don't actually generate or email
any of them

=item --time SECONDS

Instead of using the current time to figure out which dashboards should be
sent, use SECONDS (usually since midnight Jan 1st, 1970, so C<1192216018> would
be Oct 12 19:06:58 GMT 2007).

=item --epoch SECONDS

Back-compat for --time SECONDS.

=item --all

Ignore subscription frequency when considering each dashboard (should only be
used with --dryrun for testing and debugging)

=item --log LEVEL

Adjust LogToSTDERR config option

=back
