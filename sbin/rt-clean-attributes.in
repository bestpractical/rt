=head1 NAME

rt-clean-attributes - clean obsolete RT attributes

=head1 SYNOPSIS

     rt-clean-attributes
     rt-clean-attributes --older 1M

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script deletes obsolete C<DeferredRecipients> attributes.

C<DeferredRecipients> attributes are used by L<rt-email-digest> to store
email to be sent at a later time, either daily or weekly. Since
L<rt-email-digest> processes transactions created at most one week in
the past, it's safe to delete C<DeferredRecipients> attributes older than
one week since they will never be accessed.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item C<--older>

Date interval in the C<< <NUM>[<unit>] >> format. Default unit is D(ays),
H(our), M(onth) and Y(ear) are also supported.

=item C<--verbose>

Show additional output on the command line when running.
