=head1 NAME

rt-dump-initialdata - Serialize an RT database to disk

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    rt-validator --check && rt-dump-initialdata

This script is used to write out the objects initialdata supports from
RT database to disk, for later import into a different RT instance.  It
requires that the data in the database be self-consistent, in order to
do so; please make sure that the database being exported passes
validation by L<rt-validator> before attempting to use
C<rt-dump-initialdata>.

While running, it will attempt to estimate the number of remaining
objects to be dumped; these estimates are pessimistic, and will be
incorrect if C<--no-users> or C<--no-groups> is used.

If the controlling terminal is large enough (more than 25 columns high)
and the C<gnuplot> program is installed, it will also show a textual
graph of the queue size over time.

=head2 OPTIONS

=over

=item B<--directory> I<name>

The name of the output directory to write data files to, which should
not exist yet; it is a fatal error if it does.  Defaults to
C<< ./I<$Organization>:I<Date>/ >>, where I<$Organization> is as set in
F<RT_SiteConfig.pm>, and I<Date> is today's date.

=item B<--force>

Remove the output directory before starting.

=item B<--no-users>

By default, all privileged users are dumped; passing C<--no-users>
limits it to only those users which are referenced by dumped tickets
and history, and are thus necessary for internal consistency.

=item B<--no-groups>

By default, all groups are dumped; passing C<--no-groups> limits it
to only system-internal groups, which are needed for internal
consistency.

=item B<--no-assets>

By default, all assets are dumped; passing C<--no-assets> skips
assets during serialization.

=item B<--no-disabled>

By default, all queues, custom fields, etc, including disabled ones, are
dumped; passing C<--no-disabled> skips such disabled records during
serialization.

=item B<--no-deleted>

By default, all assets, including deleted ones, are dumped; passing
C<--no-deleted> skips deleted assets.

=item B<--no-scrips>

By default, all scrips and templates are dumped; passing C<--no-scrips>
skips them.

=item B<--no-acls>

By default, all ACLs are dumped; passing C<--no-acls> skips them.

=item B<--sync>

By default, record ids are ordinarily excluded. Pass C<--sync> to
include record ids if you intend to use this for sync rather than
creating a generic initialdata.

=item B<--gc> I<n>

Adjust how often the garbage collection sweep is done; lower numbers are
more frequent.  It shares the same code with C<rt-serializer>, See
L<rt-serializer/GARBAGE COLLECTION>.

=item B<--page> I<n>

Adjust how many rows are pulled from the database in a single query.  Disable
paging by setting this to 0.  Defaults to 100.

=item B<--quiet>

Do not show graphical progress UI.

=item B<--verbose>

Do not show graphical progress UI, but rather log was each row is
written out.
