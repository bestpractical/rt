<&| /Widgets/TitleBox, title => loc('RT Configuration') &>
<p>RT has dozens of configuration options to allow you to modify RT to meet your needs. You can view details about each configuration option online in the <a href="https://docs.bestpractical.com/rt/latest/RT_Config.html" target="_blank">RT documentation</a> or in the file <code>etc/RT_Config.pm</code> on your RT server. You can set global configuration options in the file <code>etc/RT_SiteConfig.pm</code> or right in the browser by clicking the Edit link.</p>
<p>Changes made in the web interface take precedence over customizations in server configuration files. Some core settings can only be changed in configuration files. If you need to undo a change, check "Reset" and Save to completely clear the value set in the web UI.</p>
