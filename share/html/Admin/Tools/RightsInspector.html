<p>The Rights Inspector lets you search your configured permissions based
on several different criteria. Each permission consists of a "Principal"
(which user, group, or role has the permission), an "Object" (what
record they have permissions on), and a "Right" (the name of the
permission). Rights Inspector lets you filter your permissions for any
combination of those three.</p>

<p>The "Right" field lets you specify partial and/or multiple rights
(e.g. searching <kbd>Ticket</kbd> will match both "ShowTicket" and
"ModifyTicket", while <kbd>ShowAsset ShowCatalog</kbd> will show results
for both rights). Since "SuperUser" provides every other right, it will
also be included in results when applicable.</p>

<p>The "Principal" and "Object" search fields by default work based on
filtering. For example typing Principal <kbd>arch</kbd> will show
permissions granted to the user "Archibald", the Group "Monarchs", the
custom role "Researcher", and so on. You can also filter using other RT
concepts by providing search terms like <kbd>user</kbd>,
<kbd>article</kbd>, and so on.</p>

<p>Alternatively, these two search fields support a special mode where
you may specify a unique record directly using syntax like
<kbd>group:Sales</kbd>. This will show recursive memberships (such as
rights granted to any groups that the Sales group is a member of). It
will also show rights granted by being a member of an individual
ticket's or asset's role groups. Similarly, searching for a specific
ticket with syntax like <kbd>t:10</kbd> will show you the permissions
for that single ticket and its queue.</p>

<p>Any word prefixed with a <kbd>!</kbd> will be filtered out from the
search results, for example searching for right
<kbd>ShowTicket !SuperUser</kbd>.</p>

<p>For example, to help answer the question "why can Joe see asset #39?"
you may specify principal <kbd>user:Joe</kbd>, object <kbd>asset
#39</kbd>, right <kbd>ShowAsset</kbd>. This will produce multiple
results if Joe has access due to multiple different reasons.</p>
