<p><&|/l&>Help us set up some useful defaults for RT.</&></p>

<p><&|/l&>When RT sends an email it sets the From: and Reply-To: headers so users can add to the conversation by just hitting Reply in their mail client.  It uses different addresses for Replies and Comments.  These can be changed for each of your queues.  These addresses will need to be configured to use the <tt>rt-mailgate</tt> program.</&></p>
