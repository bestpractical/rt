<&|/l&>RT works with a number of different databases. <b>MySQL</b>, <b>PostgreSQL</b>, <b>Oracle</b> and <b>SQLite</b> are all supported.</&>
</p>
<p>
<&|/l&>You should choose the database you or your local database administrator is most comfortable with.</&>
</p>
    <p><b>
<&|/l&>SQLite is a database that doesn't need a server or any configuration whatsoever. RT's authors recommend it for testing, demoing and development, but it's not quite right for a high-volume production RT server.</&>
</b></p>
<p>
<&|/l_unsafe, '<a href="http://search.cpan.org" target="_blank">CPAN</a>' &>If your preferred database isn't listed in the dropdown below, that means RT couldn't find a <i>database driver</i> for it installed locally. You may be able to remedy this by using [_1] to download and install DBD::MySQL, DBD::Oracle or DBD::Pg.</&>
