%# Get a list of possible owners for a ticket in QuickCreate.
%# Nobody is always a possibility; CurrentUser is a possibility
%# if and only if the user has OwnTicket rights in the
%# specified queue.
%# The output is a JSON array.  Each element of this array
%# is a three-element array:
%# [owner_id, owner_name, is_selected]
%# where owner_id is the user ID of the possible owner, name is either
%# 'Me' or 'Nobody', and is_selected is true if this should be the
%# currently-selected owner option.

<%ARGS>
$default_owner => -1
$queue_id => -1
