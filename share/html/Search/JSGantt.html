%# Data flow here:
%#   The page receives a Query from the previous page, and maybe arguments
%#   corresponding to actions.  (If it doesn't get a Query argument, it pulls
%#   one out of the session hash.  Also, it could be getting just a raw query from
%#   Build/Edit.html (Advanced).)
%#
%#   After doing some stuff with default arguments and saved searches, the ParseQuery
%#   function (which is similar to, but not the same as, _parser in lib/RT/Tickets_SQL.pm)
%#   converts the Query into a RT::Interface::Web::QueryBuilder::Tree.  This mason file
%#   then adds stuff to or modifies the tree based on the actions that had been requested
%#   by clicking buttons.  It then calls GetQueryAndOptionList on the tree to generate
%#   the SQL query (which is saved as a hidden input) and the option list for the Clauses
%#   box in the top right corner.
%#
%#   Worthwhile refactoring: the tree manipulation code for the actions could use some cleaning
%#   up.  The node-adding code is different in the "add" actions from in ParseQuery, which leads
%#   to things like ParseQuery correctly not quoting numbers in numerical fields, while the "add"
%#   action does quote it (this breaks SQLite).
