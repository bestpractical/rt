=head1 NAME

  RT::CurrentUser - an RT object representing the current user

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use RT::CurrentUser;

    # load
    my $current_user = RT::CurrentUser->new;
    $current_user->Load(...);
    # or
    my $current_user = RT::CurrentUser->new( $user_obj );
    # or
    my $current_user = RT::CurrentUser->new( $address || $name || $id );

    # manipulation
    $current_user->UserObj->SetName('new_name');


=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Read-only> subclass of L<RT::User> class. Used to define the current
user. You should pass an instance of this class to constructors of
many RT classes, then the instance used to check ACLs and localize
strings.

=head1 METHODS

See also L<RT::User> for a list of methods this class has.

=head2 new

Returns new CurrentUser object. Unlike all other classes of RT it takes
either subclass of C<RT::User> class object or scalar value that is
passed to Load method.

=cut

use strict;

#The basic idea here is that $self->CurrentUser is always supposed
# to be a CurrentUser object. but that's hard to do when we're trying to load
# the CurrentUser object

        }
    }

=head2 Create, Delete and Set*

As stated above it's a subclass of L<RT::User>, but this class is read-only
and calls to these methods are illegal. Return 'permission denied' message
and log an error.

=cut

=head2 UserObj

Returns the L<RT::User> object associated with this CurrentUser object.

=cut
