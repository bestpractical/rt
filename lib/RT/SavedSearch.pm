=head1 NAME

RT::SavedSearch - an API for saving and retrieving search form values.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RT::SavedSearch

=head1 DESCRIPTION

SavedSearch is an object based on L<RT::SharedSetting> that can belong
to either an L<RT::User> or an L<RT::Group>. It consists of an ID,
a description, and a number of search parameters.

=cut

package RT::SavedSearch;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base qw/RT::SharedSetting/;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 ObjectName

An object of this class is called "search"

=cut

sub ObjectName { "search" } # loc

sub PostLoad {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{'Type'} = $self->{'Attribute'}->SubValue('SearchType');
}

sub SaveAttribute {
    my $self   = shift;
    my $object = shift;
    my $args   = shift;

    my $params = $args->{'SearchParams'};

    $params->{'SearchType'} = $args->{'Type'} || 'Ticket';

    return $object->AddAttribute(
        'Name'        => 'SavedSearch',
        'Description' => $args->{'Name'},
        'Content'     => $params,
    );
}


sub UpdateAttribute {
    my $self = shift;
    my $args = shift;
    my $params = $args->{'SearchParams'} || {};

    my ($status, $msg) = $self->{'Attribute'}->SetSubValues(%$params);

    if ($status && $args->{'Name'}) {
        ($status, $msg) = $self->{'Attribute'}->SetDescription($args->{'Name'});
    }

    return ($status, $msg);
}

=head2 RT::SavedSearch->EscapeDescription STRING

This is a class method because system-level saved searches aren't true
C<RT::SavedSearch> objects but direct C<RT::Attribute> objects.

Returns C<STRING> with all square brackets except those in C<[_1]> escaped,
ready for passing as the first argument to C<loc()>.

=cut

sub EscapeDescription {
    my $self = shift;
    my $desc = shift;
    if ($desc) {
        # We only use [_1] in saved search descriptions, so let's escape other "["
        # and "]" unless they are escaped already.
        $desc =~ s/(?<!~)\[(?!_1\])/~[/g;
        $desc =~ s/(?<!~)(?<!\[_1)\]/~]/g;
    }
    return $desc;
}

=head2 Type

Returns the type of this search, e.g. 'Ticket'.  Useful for denoting the
saved searches that are relevant to a particular search page.

=cut

sub Type {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'Type'};
}

### Internal methods

# _PrivacyObjects: returns a list of objects that can be used to load, create,
# etc. saved searches from. You probably want to use the wrapper methods like
# ObjectsForLoading, ObjectsForCreating, etc.

sub _PrivacyObjects {
    my $self        = shift;
    my ($has_attr) = @_;
    my $CurrentUser = $self->CurrentUser;

    my $groups = RT::Groups->new($CurrentUser);
    $groups->LimitToUserDefinedGroups;
    $groups->WithCurrentUser;
    if ($has_attr) {
        my $attrs = $groups->Join(
            ALIAS1 => 'main',
            FIELD1 => 'id',
            TABLE2 => 'Attributes',
            FIELD2 => 'ObjectId',
        );
        $groups->Limit(
            ALIAS => $attrs,
            FIELD => 'ObjectType',
            VALUE => 'RT::Group',
        );
        $groups->Limit(
            ALIAS => $attrs,
            FIELD => 'Name',
            VALUE => $has_attr,
        );
    }

    return ( $CurrentUser->UserObj, @{ $groups->ItemsArrayRef() } );
}

    my $self = shift;
    return grep { $self->CurrentUserCanSee($_) } $self->_PrivacyObjects( "SavedSearch" );
