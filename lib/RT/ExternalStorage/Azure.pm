=head1 NAME

RT::ExternalStorage::Azure - Store files in Azure cloud

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Set(%ExternalStorage,
        Type            => 'Azure',
        AccountName     => '...',
        AccountKey      => '...',
        ContainerName   => '...',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This storage option places attachments in the Azure cloud file storage
service.  The files are de-duplicated when they are saved; as such, if
the same file appears in multiple transactions, only one copy will be
stored in Azure.

Files in Azure B<must not be modified or removed>; doing so may cause
internal inconsistency.  It is also important to ensure that the Azure
account used maintains sufficient funds for your RT's B<storage and
bandwidth> needs.

=head1 SETUP

In order to use this storage type, you must grant RT access to your
Azure Storage account.

=over

=item 1.

Log into Azure, L<https://portal.azure.com/>, and create or open a
"Storage account" you wish to store files under.

=item 2.

Navigate to "Access Keys" in the Settings for the Storage account.

=item 3.

Open the "Access Keys" pane.

=item 4.

Read about key generation and if necessary, generate a key.

=item 5.

Copy the "Storage account name" and one of the provided "Key" values into
 your F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> file:

    Set(%ExternalStorage,
        Type            => 'Azure',
        AccountName     => '...', # Put Storage ccount name between quotes
        AccountKey      => '...', # Put Secret Access Key between quotes
        ContainerName   => '...',
    );

=item 6.

Set up a Container for RT to use. You can either create and configure it
in the Azure web interface, or let RT create one itself. Either way, tell
RT what Container name to use in your F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> file:

    Set(%ExternalStorage,
        Type            => 'Azure',
        AccountName     => '...',
        AccountKey      => '...',
        ContainerName   => '...', # Put Container name between quotes
    );

=back

=head2 Direct Linking

This storage engine supports direct linking. This means that RT can link
I<directly> to Azure when listing attachments, showing image previews, etc.
This relieves some bandwidth pressure from RT because ordinarily it would
have to download each attachment from Azure to be able to serve it.

To enable direct linking you must first make all blobs in your container
publicly viewable.

B<Beware that this could have serious implications for billing and
privacy>. RT cannot enforce its access controls for content on Azure. This
is tempered somewhat by the fact that users must be able to guess the
SHA-256 digest of the file to be able to access it. But there is nothing
stopping someone from tweeting a URL to a file hosted on your Azure. These
concerns do not arise when using an RT-mediated link to Azure, since RT
uses an access key to upload to and download from Azure.

To make all content in an Azure container publicly viewable, navigate to
the container in the Azure web UI. Click the "Change access level" link
and set the "Public access level" to "Blob".

Finally, set C<$ExternalStorageDirectLink> to 1 in your
F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> file:

    Set($ExternalStorageDirectLink, 1);

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

=head2 Issues Connecting to the Azure storage cloud

Here are some things to check if you receive errors connecting to Azure.

=over

=item *

Double check all of the configuration parameters, including the container name. Remember to restart
the server after changing values for RT to load new settings.

=item *

Check the permissions on the container and make sure they are sufficient for the user RT is
connecting as to upload and access files.
