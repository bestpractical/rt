=head1 NAME

RT::ExternalStorage::Disk - On-disk storage of attachments

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Set(%ExternalStorage,
        Type => 'Disk',
        Path => '/opt/rt5/var/attachments',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This storage option places attachments on disk under the given C<Path>,
uncompressed.  The files are de-duplicated when they are saved; as such,
if the same file appears in multiple transactions, only one copy will be
stored on disk.

The C<Path> must be readable by the web server, and writable by the
C<sbin/rt-externalize-attachments> script.  Because the majority of the
attachments are in the filesystem, a simple database backup is thus
incomplete.  It is B<extremely important> that I<backups include the
on-disk attachments directory>.

Files also C<must not be modified or removed>; doing so may cause
internal inconsistency.
