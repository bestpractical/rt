=head1 NAME

RT::ExternalStorage::Dropbox - Store files in the Dropbox cloud

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Set(%ExternalStorage,
        Type => 'Dropbox',
        AccessToken => '...',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This storage option places attachments in the Dropbox shared file
service.  The files are de-duplicated when they are saved; as such, if
the same file appears in multiple transactions, only one copy will be
stored in Dropbox.

Files in Dropbox B<must not be modified or removed>; doing so may cause
internal inconsistency.  It is also important to ensure that the Dropbox
account used has sufficient space for the attachments, and to monitor
its space usage.

=head1 SETUP

In order to use this storage type, a new application must be registered
with Dropbox:

=over

=item 1.

Log into Dropbox as the user you wish to store files as.

=item 2.

Click C<Create app> on L<https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps>

=item 3.

Choose B<Dropbox API app> as the type of app.

=item 4.

Choose B<App Folder> for the Type of Access; your application only needs access to files it creates.

=item 5.

Enter a descriptive name -- C<Request Tracker files> is fine.

=item 6.

Check the checkbox for B<Terms and Conditions> (if present) and then click C<Create App>.

=item 7.

Under C<Generated access token>, click the C<Generate> button.

=item 8.

Copy the provided value into your F<RT_SiteConfig.pm> file as the
C<AccessToken>:

    Set(%ExternalStorage,
        Type => 'Dropbox',
        AccessToken => '...',   # Replace the value here, between the quotes
    );
