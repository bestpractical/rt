=head1 NAME

RT::CustomFieldValues::External - Pull possible values for a custom
field from an arbitrary external data source.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Custom field value lists can be produced by creating a class that
inherits from C<RT::CustomFieldValues::External>, and overloading
C<SourceDescription> and C<ExternalValues>.  See
L<RT::CustomFieldValues::Groups> for a simple example.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Subclasses should implement the following methods:

=head2 SourceDescription

This method should return a string describing the data source; this is
the identifier by which the user will see the dropdown.

=head2 ExternalValues

This method should return an array reference of hash references.  The
hash references must contain a key for C<name> and can optionally contain
keys for C<description>, C<sortorder>, and C<category>. If supplying a
category, you must also set the category the custom field is based on in
the custom field configuration page.
