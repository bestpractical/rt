Return members who belong to any of the groups passed in the groups whose IDs
are included in the Groups arrayref.

If IncludeSubgroupMembers is true (default) then members of any group that's a
member of one of the passed groups are returned. If it's cleared then only
direct member users are returned.

If IncludeUnprivileged is false (default) then only privileged members are
returned; otherwise either privileged or unprivileged group members may be
returned.

=head2 SimpleSearch

Does a 'simple' search of Users against a specified Term.

This Term is compared to a number of fields using various types of SQL
comparison operators.

Ensures that the returned collection of Users will have a value for Return.

This method is passed the following.  You must specify a Term and a Return.

    Privileged - Whether or not to limit to Privileged Users (0 or 1)
    Fields     - Hashref of data - defaults to C<$UserSearchFields> emulate that if you want to override
    Term       - String that is in the fields specified by Fields
    Return     - What field on the User you want to be sure isn't empty
    Exclude    - Array reference of ids to exclude
    Max        - What to limit this collection to
