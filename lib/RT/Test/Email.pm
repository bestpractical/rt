  use RT::Test::Email;

  mail_ok {
    # ... code

  } { from => 'admin@localhost', body => qr('hello') },
    { from => 'admin@localhost', body => qr('hello again') };

  # ... more code

This is a test helper module for RT, allowing you to expect mail
notification generated during the block or the test.
