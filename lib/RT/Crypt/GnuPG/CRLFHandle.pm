# means that the output of $entity->print contains lines terminated by
# "\n"; however, signatures are generated off of the "correct" form of
# the MIME entity, which uses "\r\n" as the newline separator.  This
# class, used only when generating signatures, transparently munges "\n"
# newlines into "\r\n" newlines such that the generated signature is
# correct for the "\r\n"-newline version of the MIME entity which will
# eventually be sent over the wire.
