=head1 NAME

  RT::ACL - collection of RT ACE objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RT::ACL;
my $ACL = RT::ACL->new($CurrentUser);

=head1 DESCRIPTION


=head1 METHODS


=cut


package RT::ACL;
use base 'RT::SearchBuilder';

use RT::ACE;

sub Table { 'ACL'}

use strict;
use warnings;



=head2 Next

Hand out the next ACE that was found

=cut



=head2 LimitToObject $object

Limit the ACL to rights for the object $object. It needs to be an RT::Record class.

=cut

sub LimitToObject {
    my $self = shift;
    my $obj  = shift;

    my $obj_type = ref($obj)||$obj;
    my $obj_id = eval { $obj->id};

    my $object_clause = 'possible_objects';
    $self->_OpenParen($object_clause);
    $self->Limit(
        SUBCLAUSE       => $object_clause,
        FIELD           => 'ObjectType',
        OPERATOR        => '=',
        VALUE           => (ref($obj)||$obj),
        ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR' # That "OR" applies to the separate objects we're searching on, not "Type Or ID"
    );
    if ($obj_id) {
    $self->Limit(
        SUBCLAUSE       => $object_clause,
        FIELD           => 'ObjectId',
        OPERATOR        => '=',
        VALUE           => $obj_id,
        ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'AND',
        QUOTEVALUE      => 0
    );
    }
    $self->_CloseParen($object_clause);

}



=head2 LimitToPrincipal { Type => undef, Id => undef, IncludeGroupMembership => undef }

Limit the ACL to the principal with PrincipalId Id and PrincipalType Type

Id is not optional.
Type is.

if IncludeGroupMembership => 1 is specified, ACEs which apply to the principal due to group membership will be included in the resultset.
