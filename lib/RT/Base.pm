=head1 SYNOPSIS

=head1 DESCRIPTION

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=cut


=head2 CurrentUser

If called with an argument, sets the current user to that user object.
This will affect ACL decisions, etc. The argument can be either
L<RT::CurrentUser> or L<RT::User> object.

Returns the current user object of L<RT::CurrentUser> class.

=cut

sub CurrentUser {
    my $self = shift;

    if (@_) {
        $self->{'original_user'} = $self->{'user'};
        my $current_user = $_[0];
        if ( ref $current_user eq 'RT::User' ) {
            $self->{'user'} = RT::CurrentUser->new;
            $self->{'user'}->Load( $current_user->id );
        } else {
            $self->{'user'} = $current_user;
        }
        # We need to weaken the CurrentUser ($self->{'user'}) reference
        # if the object in question is the currentuser object.
        # This avoids memory leaks.
        Scalar::Util::weaken($self->{'user'})
            if ref $self->{'user'} && $self->{'user'} == $self;
    }

    return ( $self->{'user'} );
}


sub OriginalUser {
    my $self = shift;

    if (@_) {
        $self->{'original_user'} = shift;
        Scalar::Util::weaken($self->{'original_user'})
            if (ref($self->{'original_user'}) && $self->{'original_user'} == $self );
    }
    return ( $self->{'original_user'} || $self->{'user'} );
}


=head2 loc LOC_STRING

l is a method which takes a loc string
to this object's CurrentUser->LanguageHandle for localization. 

you call it like this:

    $self->loc("I have [quant,_1,concrete mixer,concrete mixers].", 6);

In english, this would return:
    I have 6 concrete mixers.


=cut

sub loc {
    my $self = shift;
    if (my $user = $self->OriginalUser) {
        return $user->loc(@_);
    }

        Carp::confess("No currentuser");
        return ("Critical error:$self has no CurrentUser", $self);
    }
}

        return $user->loc_fuzzy(@_);
