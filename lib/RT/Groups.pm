# XXX: below some code is marked as subject to generalize in Groups, Users classes.
# RUZ suggest name Principals::Generic or Principals::Base as abstract class, but
# Jesse wants something that doesn't imply it's a Principals.pm subclass.
# See comments below for candidats.

    TABLE2 => 'Principals',
    FIELD2 => 'id'
  );

  # even if this condition is useless and ids in the Groups table
  # only match principals with type 'Group' this could speed up
  # searches in some DBs.
  $self->Limit( ALIAS => $self->{'princalias'},
                FIELD => 'PrincipalType',

Returns the string that represents this Users object's primary "Principals" alias.

=cut

# XXX: should be generalized, code duplication
sub PrincipalsAlias {
    my $self = shift;
    return($self->{'princalias'});

}



=head2 LimitToSystemInternalGroups

Return only SystemInternal Groups, such as "privileged" "unprivileged" and "everyone" 

=cut

    # All system internal groups have the same instance. No reason to limit down further

Return only UserDefined Groups

=cut

}

=head2 LimitToRolesForObject OBJECT

Limits the set of groups to role groups specifically for the object in question
based on the object's class and ID.  If the object has no ID, the roles are not
limited by group C<Instance>.  That is, calling this method on an unloaded
object will find all role groups for that class of object.

Replaces L</LimitToRolesForQueue>, L</LimitToRolesForTicket>, and
L</LimitToRolesForSystem>.

=head2 LimitToRolesForQueue QUEUE_ID

B<DEPRECATED>. Use L</LimitToRolesForObject> instead.
