=head1 NAME

RT::Record::Role::LookupType - Common methods for records which have a LookupType

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Certain records, like custom fields, can be applied to different types of
records (tickets, transactions, groups, users, etc). This role implements
such I<LookupType> concerns.

This role does not manage concerns relating to specifying which records
of a class (as in L<RT::ObjectCustomField>).

=head1 REQUIRES

=head2 L<RT::Record::Role>

=head2 LookupType

A C<LookupType> method which returns this record's lookup type is required.
Currently unenforced at compile-time due to poor interactions with
L<DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record/AUTOLOAD>.  You'll hit run-time errors if
this method isn't available in consuming classes, however.

=cut

with 'RT::Record::Role';

=head1 PROVIDES

=head2 RegisterLookupType LOOKUPTYPE OPTIONS

Tell RT that a certain object accepts records of this role via a lookup
type. I<OPTIONS> is a hash reference for which the following keys are
used:

=over 4

=item FriendlyName

The string to display in the UI to users for this lookup type

=back

For backwards compatibility, I<OPTIONS> may also be a string which is
interpreted as specifying the I<FriendlyName>.

Examples:

    'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket'                 => "Tickets",                # loc
    'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket-RT::Transaction' => "Ticket Transactions",    # loc
    'RT::User'                             => "Users",                  # loc
    'RT::Group'                            => "Groups",                 # loc
    'RT::Queue'                            => "Queues",                 # loc

This is a class method.

Returns an array of LookupTypes available for this record or class

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    my $class = blessed($self) || $self;
    return sort keys %{ $REGISTRY{ $class } };
}

=head2 LookupTypeRegistration [PATH] [OPTION]

Returns the arguments of calls to L</RegisterLookupType>. With no arguments, returns a hash of hashes,
where the first-level key is the path (corresponding with L<RT::Record/CustomFieldLookupType>) and
the second-level hash is the option names. If path and option are provided, it looks up in that
nested hash structure to provide the desired information.

=head2 FriendlyLookupType

Returns a localized description of the LookupType of this record

=head1 RecordClassFromLookupType

Returns the type of Object referred to by ObjectCustomFields' ObjectId column.
(The first part of the LookupType, e.g. the C<RT::Queue> of
C<RT::Queue-RT::Ticket-RT::Transaction>)

Optionally takes a LookupType to use instead of using the value on the loaded
record.  In this case, the method may be called on the class instead of an
object.

=head1 ObjectTypeFromLookupType

Returns the ObjectType for this record. (The last part of the LookupType,
e.g. the C<RT::Transaction> of C<RT::Queue-RT::Ticket-RT::Transaction>)

Optionally takes a LookupType to use instead of using the value on the loaded
record.  In this case, the method may be called on the class instead of an
object.

Certain record types (users, groups) should only be added globally;
codify that set here for reference.
