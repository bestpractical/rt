=head1 NAME

RT::Record::Role::Status - Common methods for records which have a Status column

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Lifecycles are generally set on container records, and Statuses on records
which belong to one of those containers.  L<RT::Record::Role::Lifecycle>
handles the containers with the I<Lifecycle> column.  This role is for the
records with a I<Status> column within those containers.  It includes
convenience methods for grabbing an L<RT::Lifecycle> object as well setters for
validating I<Status> and the column which points to the container object.

=head1 REQUIRES

=head2 L<RT::Record::Role>

=head2 LifecycleColumn

Used as a role parameter.  Must return a string of the column name which points
to the container object that consumes L<RT::Record::Role::Lifecycle> (or
conforms to it).  The resulting string is used to construct two method names:
as-is to fetch the column value and suffixed with "Obj" to fetch the object.

=head2 Status

A Status method which returns a lifecycle name is required.  Currently
unenforced at compile-time due to poor interactions with
L<DBIx::SearchBuilder::Record/AUTOLOAD>.  You'll hit run-time errors if this
method isn't available in consuming classes, however.

=cut

with 'RT::Record::Role';
requires 'LifecycleColumn';

=head1 PROVIDES

=head2 Status

Returns the Status for this record, in the canonical casing.

=cut

sub Status {
    my $self = shift;
    my $value = $self->_Value( 'Status' );
    my $lifecycle = $self->LifecycleObj;
    return $value unless $lifecycle;
    return $lifecycle->CanonicalCase( $value );
}

=head2 LifecycleObj

Returns an L<RT::Lifecycle> object for this record's C<Lifecycle>.  If called
as a class method, returns an L<RT::Lifecycle> object which is an aggregation
of all lifecycles of the appropriate type.

=cut

sub LifecycleObj {
    my $self = shift;
    my $obj  = $self->LifecycleColumn . "Obj";
    return $self->$obj->LifecycleObj;
}

=head2 Lifecycle

Returns the L<RT::Lifecycle/Name> of this record's L</LifecycleObj>.

=cut

sub Lifecycle {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->LifecycleObj->Name;
}

=head2 ValidateStatus

Takes a status.  Returns true if that status is a valid status for this record,
otherwise returns false.

=cut

sub ValidateStatus {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->LifecycleObj->IsValid(@_);
}

=head2 ValidateStatusChange

Validates the new status with the current lifecycle.  Returns a tuple of (OK,
message).

Expected to be called from this role's L</SetStatus> or the consuming class'
equivalent.

=cut

sub ValidateStatusChange {
    my $self = shift;
    my $new  = shift;
    my $old  = $self->Status;

    my $lifecycle = $self->LifecycleObj;

    unless ( $lifecycle->IsValid( $new ) ) {
        return (0, $self->loc("Status '[_1]' isn't a valid status for this [_2].", $self->loc($new), $self->loc($lifecycle->Type)));
    }

    unless ( $lifecycle->IsTransition( $old => $new ) ) {
        return (0, $self->loc("You can't change status from '[_1]' to '[_2]'.", $self->loc($old), $self->loc($new)));
    }

    my $check_right = $lifecycle->CheckRight( $old => $new );
    unless ( $self->CurrentUser->HasRight( Right => $check_right, Object => $self ) ) {
        return ( 0, $self->loc('Permission Denied') );
    }

    return 1;
}

=head2 SetStatus

Validates the status transition before updating the Status column.  This method
may want to be overridden by a more specific method in the consuming class.

=cut

sub SetStatus {
    my $self = shift;
    my $new  = shift;

    my ($valid, $error) = $self->ValidateStatusChange($new);
    return ($valid, $error) unless $valid;

    return $self->_SetStatus( Status => $new );
}

=head2 _SetStatus

Sets the Status column without validating the change.  Intended to be used
as-is by methods provided by the role, or overridden in the consuming class to
take additional action.  For example, L<RT::Ticket/_SetStatus> sets the Started
and Resolved dates on the ticket as necessary.

Takes a paramhash where the only required key is Status.  Other keys may
include Lifecycle and NewLifecycle when called from L</_SetLifecycleColumn>,
which may assist consuming classes.  NewLifecycle defaults to Lifecycle if not
provided; this indicates the lifecycle isn't changing.

=cut

sub _SetStatus {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = (
        Status      => undef,
        Lifecycle   => $self->LifecycleObj,
        @_,
    );
    $args{Status} = lc $args{Status} if defined $args{Status};
    $args{NewLifecycle} ||= $args{Lifecycle};

    return $self->_Set(
        Field   => 'Status',
        Value   => $args{Status},
    );
}

=head2 _SetLifecycleColumn

Validates and updates the column named by L</LifecycleColumn>.  The Status
column is also updated if necessary (via lifecycle transition maps).

On success, returns a tuple of (1, I<message>, I<new status>) where I<new
status> is the status that was transitioned to, if any.  On failure, returns
(0, I<error message>).

Takes a paramhash with keys I<Value> and (optionally) I<RequireRight>.
I<RequireRight> is a right name which the current user must have on the new
L</LifecycleColumn> object in order for the method to succeed.

This method is expected to be used from within another method such as
L<RT::Ticket/SetQueue>.

=cut

    my $self = shift;
