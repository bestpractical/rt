# LookupExternalUserInfo is a site-definable method for synchronizing

#
# This routine takes a tuple of EmailAddress and FriendlyName
#   EmailAddress is the user's email address, ususally taken from
#       an email message's From: header.
#   FriendlyName is a freeform string, ususally taken from the "comment" 
#       portion of an email message's From: header.
#
# If you define an AutoRejectRequest template, RT will use this   
# template for the rejection message.


=head2 LookupExternalUserInfo

 LookupExternalUserInfo is a site-definable method for synchronizing
 incoming users with an external data source. 

 This routine takes a tuple of EmailAddress and FriendlyName
    EmailAddress is the user's email address, ususally taken from
        an email message's From: header.
    FriendlyName is a freeform string, ususally taken from the "comment" 
        portion of an email message's From: header.

 It returns (FoundInExternalDatabase, ParamHash);

   FoundInExternalDatabase must  be set to 1 before return if the user 
   was found in the external database.

   ParamHash is a Perl parameter hash which can contain at least the 
   following fields. These fields are used to populate RT's users 
   database when the user is created.

    EmailAddress is the email address that RT should use for this user.  
    Name is the 'Name' attribute RT should use for this user. 
         'Name' is used for things like access control and user lookups.
    RealName is what RT should display as the user's name when displaying 
         'friendly' names

=cut

  my $self = shift;

=head2 Head

Return the parsed head from this message

=cut

sub Head {

Return the parsed Entity from this message

A private instance method which sets up a mime parser to do its job

=head2 ParseEmailAddress string

Returns a list of Email::Address objects
Works around the bug that Email::Address 1.889 and earlier
doesn't handle local-only email addresses (when users pass
in just usernames on the RT system in fields that expect
Email Addresses)

We don't handle the case of 
bob, fred@bestpractical.com 
because we don't want to fail parsing
bob, "Falcone, Fred" <fred@bestpractical.com>
The next release of Email::Address will have a new method
we can use that removes the bandaid

=head2 CleanupAddresses ARRAY

Massages an array of L<Email::Address> objects to make their email addresses
more palatable.

Currently this strips off surrounding single quotes around C<< ->address >> and
B<< modifies the L<Email::Address> objects in-place >>.

Returns the list of objects for convienence in C<map>/C<grep> chains.

=head2 RescueOutlook 

Outlook 2007/2010 have a bug when you write an email with the html format.
it will send a 'multipart/alternative' with both 'text/plain' and 'text/html'
in it.  it's cool to have a 'text/plain' part, but the problem is the part is
not so right: all the "\n" in your main message will become "\n\n" :/

this method will fix this bug, i.e. replaces "\n\n" to "\n".
return 1 if it does find the problem in the entity and get it fixed.
