=head1 NAME

  RT::SharedSettings - a pseudo-collection for SharedSetting objects.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RT::SharedSettings

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  SharedSettings is an object consisting of a number of SharedSetting objects.
  It works more or less like a DBIx::SearchBuilder collection, although it
  is not.

=head1 METHODS


=cut

package RT::SharedSettings;

use strict;
use warnings;
use base 'RT::Base';

use RT::SharedSetting;

sub new  {
    my $proto = shift;
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;
    my $self  = {};
    bless ($self, $class);
    $self->CurrentUser(@_);
    $self->{'idx'} = 0;
    $self->{'objects'} = [];
    return $self;
}

### Accessor methods

=head2 Next

Returns the next object in the collection.

=cut

sub Next {
    my $self = shift;
    my $search = $self->{'objects'}->[$self->{'idx'}];
    if ($search) {
        $self->{'idx'}++;
    } else {
        # We have run out of objects; reset the counter.
        $self->{'idx'} = 0;
    }
    return $search;
}

=head2 Count

Returns the number of search objects found.

=cut

sub Count {
    my $self = shift;
    return scalar @{$self->{'objects'}};
}

=head2 CountAll

Returns the number of search objects found

=cut

sub CountAll {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->Count;
}

=head2 GotoPage

Act more like a normal L<DBIx::SearchBuilder> collection.
Moves the internal index around

=cut

sub GotoPage {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{idx} = shift;
}

### Internal methods

# _GetObject: helper routine to load the correct object whose parameters
#  have been passed.

sub _GetObject {
    my $self = shift;
    my $privacy = shift;

    return $self->RecordClass->new($self->CurrentUser)->_GetObject($privacy);
}

RT::Base->_ImportOverlays();
