=head1 NAME

  RT::Dashboards - a pseudo-collection for Dashboard objects.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RT::Dashboards

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  Dashboards is an object consisting of a number of Dashboard objects.
  It works more or less like a DBIx::SearchBuilder collection, although it
  is not.

=head1 METHODS


=cut

package RT::Dashboards;

use strict;
use warnings;
use base 'RT::SharedSettings';

use RT::Dashboard;

sub RecordClass {
    return 'RT::Dashboard';
}

=head2 LimitToPrivacy

Takes one argument: a privacy string, of the format "<class>-<id>", as produced
by RT::Dashboard::Privacy(). The Dashboards object will load the dashboards
belonging to that user or group. Repeated calls to the same object should DTRT.

=cut

sub LimitToPrivacy {
    my $self = shift;
    my $privacy = shift;

    my $object = $self->_GetObject($privacy);

    if ($object) {
        $self->{'objects'} = [];
        my @dashboard_atts = $object->Attributes->Named('Dashboard');
        foreach my $att (@dashboard_atts) {
            my $dashboard = RT::Dashboard->new($self->CurrentUser);
            $dashboard->Load($privacy, $att->Id);
            push(@{$self->{'objects'}}, $dashboard);
        }
    } else {
        $RT::Logger->error("Could not load object $privacy");
    }
}

sub ColumnMapClassName {
    return 'RT__Dashboard';
}
