=head2 C<constant_time_eq($a, $b)>

Compares two strings for equality in constant-time. Replacement for the C<eq>
operator designed to avoid timing side-channel vulnerabilities. Returns zero
or one.

This is intended for use in cryptographic subsystems for comparing well-formed
data such as hashes - not for direct use with user input or as a general
replacement for the C<eq> operator.

The two string arguments B<MUST> be of equal length. If the lengths differ,
this function will call C<die()>, as proceeding with execution would create
a timing vulnerability. Length is defined by characters, not bytes.

Strings that should be treated as binary octets rather than Unicode text
should pass a true value for the binary flag.

This code has been tested to do what it claims. Do not change it without
thorough statistical timing analysis to validate the changes.

Added to resolve CVE-2017-5361
