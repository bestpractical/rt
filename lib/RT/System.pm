=head1 NAME 

RT::System

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RT::System is a simple global object used as a focal point for things
that are system-wide.

It works sort of like an RT::Record, except it's really a single object that has
an id of "1" when instantiated.

This gets used by the ACL system so that you can have rights for the scope "RT::System"

In the future, there will probably be other API goodness encapsulated here.

=cut


package RT::System;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base qw/RT::Record/;

use Role::Basic 'with';
with "RT::Record::Role::Roles",
     "RT::Record::Role::Rights" => { -excludes => [qw/AvailableRights RightCategories/] };

use RT::ACL;
use RT::ACE;
use Data::GUID;

__PACKAGE__->AddRight( Admin   => SuperUser           => 'Do anything and everything'); # loc
__PACKAGE__->AddRight( Staff   => ShowUserHistory     => 'Show history of public user properties'); # loc
__PACKAGE__->AddRight( Admin   => AdminUsers          => 'Create, modify and delete users'); # loc
__PACKAGE__->AddRight( Staff   => ModifySelf          => "Modify one's own RT account"); # loc

__PACKAGE__->AddRight( Staff   => ShowGlobalTemplates => 'Show global templates'); # loc

=head2 AvailableRights

Returns a hashref of available rights for this object.  The keys are the
right names and the values are a description of what the rights do.

This method as well returns rights of other RT objects, like
L<RT::Queue> or L<RT::Group>, to allow users to apply those rights
globally.

If an L<RT::Principal> is passed as the first argument, the available
rights will be limited to ones which make sense for the principal.
Currently only role groups are supported and rights announced by object
types to which the role group doesn't apply are not returned.

=cut

sub AvailableRights {
    my $self = shift;
    my $principal = shift;
    my $class = ref($self) || $self;

    my @rights;
    if ($principal and $principal->IsRoleGroup) {

            next unless $class->DOES('RT::Record::Role::Roles') and $class->HasRole($role) and $class ne "RT::System";
            push @rights, values %{ $RT::ACE::RIGHTS{$class} };
        }

    $rights{$_->{Name}} = $_->{Description} for @rights;

    delete $rights{ExecuteCode} if RT->Config->Get('DisallowExecuteCode');

    return \%rights;
}

=head2 RightCategories

Returns a hashref where the keys are rights for this type of object and the
values are the category (General, Staff, Admin) the right falls into.

=cut

sub RightCategories {
    my $self = shift;
    my $class = ref($self) || $self;

    my %rights;
    $rights{$_->{Name}} = $_->{Category}

}

sub _Init {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->SUPER::_Init (@_) if @_ && $_[0];
}

=head2 id

Returns RT::System's id. It's 1. 

=cut

*Id = \&id;
sub id { return 1 }

sub UID { return "RT::System" }

=head2 Load

Since this object is pretending to be an RT::Record, we need a load method.
It does nothing

=cut

sub Load    { return 1 }
sub Name    { return 'RT System' }
sub __Set   { return 0 }
sub __Value { return 0 }
sub Create  { return 0 }

    my $queues = RT::Queues->new( $self->CurrentUser );
    $queues->Limit( FIELD => 'SubjectTag', OPERATOR => 'IS NOT', VALUE => 'NULL' );
    return $queues->DistinctFieldValues('SubjectTag');
}

=head2 QueueCacheNeedsUpdate ( 1 )

Attribute to decide when SelectQueue needs to flush the list of queues
and retrieve new ones.  Set when queues are created, enabled/disabled
and on certain acl changes.  Should also better understand group management.

If passed a true value, will update the attribute to be the current time.

=cut

sub QueueCacheNeedsUpdate {
    my $self = shift;
    my $update = shift;

    if ($update) {
        return $self->SetAttribute(Name => 'QueueCacheNeedsUpdate', Content => time);
    } else {

        return (defined $cache ? $cache->Content : 0 );
    }
}

=head2 AddUpgradeHistory package, data

Adds an entry to the upgrade history database. The package can be either C<RT>
for core RT upgrades, or the fully qualified name of a plugin. The data must be
a hash reference.

=cut

    $self->SetAttribute(
        Name    => 'UpgradeHistory',
        Content => $upgrade_history,
    );
}

=head2 UpgradeHistory [package]

Returns the entries of RT's upgrade history. If a package is specified, the list
of upgrades for that package will be returned. Otherwise a hash reference of
C<< package => [upgrades] >> will be returned.

=cut

sub UpgradeHistory {
    my $self  = shift;
