  RT::Attachments - a collection of RT::Attachment objects

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use RT::Attachments;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module should never be called directly by client code. it's an internal module which
should only be accessed through exported APIs in Ticket, Queue and other similar objects.


=head1 METHODS

use strict;
use warnings;

use base 'RT::SearchBuilder';

    delete $self->{_sql_transaction_alias};
    return $self->SUPER::CleanSlate( @_ );
}


=head2 TransactionAlias

Returns alias for transactions table with applied join condition.
Always return the same alias, so if you want to build some complex
or recursive joining then you have to create new alias youself.

=cut

        FIELD1 => 'TransactionId',
        TABLE2 => 'Transactions',
        FIELD2 => 'id',
    );
}

=head2 ContentType (VALUE => 'text/plain', ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR', OPERATOR => '=' ) 

Limit result set to attachments of ContentType 'TYPE'...
