package RT::CustomFields;

use strict;
use warnings;

use base 'RT::SearchBuilder';

use RT::CustomField;

sub Table { 'CustomFields'}

  # By default, order by SortOrder
  $self->OrderByCols(
         { ALIAS => 'main',
           FIELD => 'SortOrder',
           ORDER => 'ASC' },

=head2 LimitToGrouping

Limits this collection object to custom fields which appear under a
specified grouping by calling L</Limit> for each CF name as appropriate.

Requires an L<RT::Record> object or class name as the first argument and
accepts a grouping name as the second.  If the grouping name is false
(usually via the empty string), limits to custom fields which appear in no
grouping.

I<Caveat:> While the record object or class name is used to find the
available groupings, no automatic limit is placed on the lookup type of
the custom fields.  It's highly suggested you limit the collection by
queue or another lookup type first.  This is already done for you if
you're creating the collection via the L</CustomFields> method on an
L<RT::Record> object.

=cut

sub LimitToGrouping {
    my $self = shift;
    my $obj = shift;
    my $grouping = shift;

            OPERATOR      => 'IN',

=head2 LimitToLookupType

Takes LookupType and limits collection.

=cut

sub LimitToLookupType  {
    my $self = shift;
    my $lookup = shift;

    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', VALUE => "$lookup" );
}

=head2 LimitToChildType

Takes partial LookupType and limits collection to records
where LookupType is equal or ends with the value.

=cut

sub LimitToChildType  {
    my $self = shift;
    my $lookup = shift;

    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', VALUE => "$lookup" );
    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', ENDSWITH => "$lookup" );
}


=head2 LimitToParentType

Takes partial LookupType and limits collection to records
where LookupType is equal or starts with the value.

=cut

sub LimitToParentType  {
    my $self = shift;
    my $lookup = shift;

    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', VALUE => "$lookup" );
    $self->Limit( FIELD => 'LookupType', STARTSWITH => "$lookup" );
}

=head2 LimitToObjectId

Takes an ObjectId and limits the collection to CFs applied to said object.

When called multiple times the ObjectId limits are joined with OR.

=cut

sub LimitToObjectId {
    my $self = shift;
    my $id = shift;
    $self->Limit(
        ALIAS           => $self->_OCFAlias,
        FIELD           => 'ObjectId',
        OPERATOR        => '=',
        VALUE           => $id || 0,
        ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR'
    );
}

=head2 LimitToGlobalOrObjectId

Takes list of object IDs and limits collection to custom
fields that are added to these objects or globally.

=cut

sub LimitToGlobalOrObjectId {
    my $self = shift;
    my $global_only = 1;


    foreach my $id (@_) {
        $self->LimitToObjectId($id);
        $global_only = 0 if $id;
    }

    $self->LimitToObjectId(0) unless $global_only;
}

=head2 LimitToNotAdded

Takes either list of object ids or nothing. Limits collection
to custom fields to listed objects or any corespondingly. Use
zero to mean global.

=cut

sub LimitToNotAdded {
    my $self = shift;
    return RT::ObjectCustomFields->new( $self->CurrentUser )
        ->LimitTargetToNotAdded( $self => @_ );
}

=head2 LimitToAdded

Limits collection to custom fields to listed objects or any corespondingly. Use
zero to mean global.

=cut

sub LimitToAdded {
    my $self = shift;
    return RT::ObjectCustomFields->new( $self->CurrentUser )
        ->LimitTargetToAdded( $self => @_ );
}

=head2 LimitToGlobalOrQueue QUEUEID

Limits the set of custom fields found to global custom fields or those
tied to the queue C<QUEUEID>, similar to L</LimitToGlobalOrObjectId>.

Note that this will cause the collection to only return ticket CFs.

=cut

sub LimitToGlobalOrQueue {
    my $self = shift;
    my $queue = shift;
    $self->LimitToGlobalOrObjectId( $queue );
    $self->LimitToLookupType( 'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket' );
}


=head2 LimitToQueue QUEUEID

Takes a numeric C<QUEUEID>, and limits the Custom Field collection to
those only applied directly to it; this limit is OR'd with other
L</LimitToQueue> and L</LimitToGlobal> limits.

Note that this will cause the collection to only return ticket CFs.

=cut

sub LimitToQueue  {
   my $self = shift;
   my $queue = shift;

   $self->Limit (ALIAS => $self->_OCFAlias,
                 ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR',
                 FIELD => 'ObjectId',
                 VALUE => "$queue")
       if defined $queue;
   $self->LimitToLookupType( 'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket' );
}


=head2 LimitToGlobal

Limits the Custom Field collection to global ticket CFs; this limit is
OR'd with L</LimitToQueue> limits.

Note that this will cause the collection to only return ticket CFs.

=cut

sub LimitToGlobal  {
   my $self = shift;

  $self->Limit (ALIAS => $self->_OCFAlias,
                ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR',
                FIELD => 'ObjectId',
                VALUE => 0);
  $self->LimitToLookupType( 'RT::Queue-RT::Ticket' );
}


=head2 ApplySortOrder

Sort custom fields according to thier order application to objects. It's
expected that collection contains only records of one
L<RT::CustomField/LookupType> and applied to one object or globally
(L</LimitToGlobalOrObjectId>), otherwise sorting makes no sense.

=cut

sub ApplySortOrder {
    my $self = shift;
    my $order = shift || 'ASC';
    $self->OrderByCols( {
        ALIAS => $self->_OCFAlias,
        FIELD => 'SortOrder',
        ORDER => $order,
    } );
}


=head2 ContextObject

Returns context object for this collection of custom fields,
but only if it's defined.

=cut

sub ContextObject {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'context_object'};
}


=head2 SetContextObject

Sets context object for this collection of custom fields.

=cut

sub SetContextObject {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{'context_object'} = shift;
}


sub _OCFAlias {
    my $self = shift;
    return RT::ObjectCustomFields->new( $self->CurrentUser )
        ->JoinTargetToThis( $self => @_ );
}


=head2 AddRecord

Overrides the collection to ensure that only custom fields the user can
see are returned; also propagates down the L</ContextObject>.

=cut

sub AddRecord {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($record) = @_;

    $record->SetContextObject( $self->ContextObject );
    return unless $record->CurrentUserHasRight('SeeCustomField');
    return $self->SUPER::AddRecord( $record );
}

=head2 NewItem

Returns an empty new RT::CustomField item
Overrides <RT::SearchBuilder/NewItem> to make sure </ContextObject>
is inherited.

=cut

sub NewItem {
    my $self = shift;
    my $res = RT::CustomField->new($self->CurrentUser);
    $res->SetContextObject($self->ContextObject);
    return $res;
}

RT::Base->_ImportOverlays();
