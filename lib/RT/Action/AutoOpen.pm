=head1 DESCRIPTION

This action automatically moves a ticket to an active status.

Status is not changed if there is no active statuses in the lifecycle.

Status is not changed if the current status is first active for ticket's status
lifecycle. For example if ticket's status is 'processing' and active statuses are
'processing', 'on hold' and 'waiting' then status is not changed, but for ticket
with status 'on hold' other rules are checked.

Status is not changed if it's in the list of C<initial> statuses for the
current scheme and creator of the current transaction
is one of the ticket's requestors.

Status is not changed if message's head has field C<RT-Control> with C<no-autoopen>
substring.

Status is set to the first possible active status. If the ticket's
status is C<Stalled> then RT finds all possible transitions from C<Stalled>
status and selects first one that results in the ticket having an
active status.
