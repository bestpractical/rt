=head1 NAME

RT::Action::RecordCorrespondence - An Action which can be used from an
external tool, or in any situation where a ticket transaction has not
been started, to create a correspondence on the ticket.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

my $action_obj = RT::Action::RecordCorrespondence->new(
			'TicketObj'   => $ticket_obj,
			'TemplateObj' => $template_obj,
			);
my $result = $action_obj->Prepare();
$action_obj->Commit() if $result;

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Prepare

Check for the existence of a Transaction.  If a Transaction already
exists, and is of type "Comment" or "Correspond", abort because that
will give us a loop.

=cut


sub Prepare {
    my $self = shift;
    if (defined $self->{'TransactionObj'} &&
	$self->{'TransactionObj'}->Type =~ /^(Comment|Correspond)$/) {
	return undef;
    }
    return 1;
}

=head2 Commit

Create a Transaction by calling the ticket's Correspond method on our
parsed Template, which may have an RT-Send-Cc or RT-Send-Bcc header.
The Transaction will be of type Correspond.  This Transaction can then
be used by the scrips that actually send the email.

=cut

sub Commit {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->CreateTransaction();
}

sub CreateTransaction {
    my $self = shift;

    my ($result, $msg) = $self->{'TemplateObj'}->Parse(
	TicketObj => $self->{'TicketObj'});
    return undef unless $result;
    
    my ($trans, $desc, $transaction) = $self->{'TicketObj'}->Correspond(
	MIMEObj => $self->TemplateObj->MIMEObj);
    $self->{'TransactionObj'} = $transaction;
}
