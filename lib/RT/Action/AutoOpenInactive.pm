=head1 DESCRIPTION

This action automatically moves an inactive ticket to an active status.

Status is not changed if there is no active statuses in the lifecycle.

Status is not changed if message's head has field C<RT-Control> with
C<no-autoopen> substring.

Status is set to the first possible active status. If the ticket's status is
C<Resolved> then RT finds all possible transitions from C<Resolved> status and
selects first one that results in the ticket having an active status.
