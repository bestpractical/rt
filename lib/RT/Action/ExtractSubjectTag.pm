=head1 NAME

  RT::Action::ExtractSubjectTag

=head1 DESCRIPTION

ExtractSubjectTag is a ScripAction which allows ticket bonding between
two RT instances or between RT and other Ticket systems like Siebel
or Remedy.

By default this ScripAction is set up to run on every transaction on
every Correspondence.

One can configure this ScripActions behaviour by changing the
global C<$ExtractSubjectTagMatch> in C<RT_Config.pm>.

If a transaction's subject matches this regexp, we append the match
tag to the ticket's current subject. This helps ensure that
further communication on the ticket will include the remote
system's subject tag.

If you modify this code, be careful not to remove the code where it
ensures that it only examines remote systems' tags.

=head1 EXAMPLE

As an example, Siebel will set their subject tag to something
like:

    B<[SR ID:1-554]>

To record this tag in the local ticket's subject, we need to change
ExtractSubjectTagMatch to something like:

    Set($ExtractSubjectTagMatch, qr/\[[^\]]+[#:][0-9-]+\]/);
