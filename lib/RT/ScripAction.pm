=head1 SEE ALSO

This class allows "overlay" methods to be placed
into the following files _Overlay is for a System overlay by the original author,
_Vendor is for 3rd-party vendor add-ons, while _Local is for site-local customizations.  

These overlay files can contain new subs or subs to replace existing subs in this module.

Each of these files should begin with the line 

   no warnings qw(redefine);

so that perl does not kick and scream when you redefine a subroutine or variable in your overlay.

RT::ScripAction_Overlay, RT::ScripAction_Vendor, RT::ScripAction_Local
