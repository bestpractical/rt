=head1 NAME

RT::ObjectScrip - record representing addition of a scrip to a queue

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This record is created if you want to add a scrip to a queue or globally.

Inherits methods from L<RT::Record::AddAndSort>.

For most operations it's better to use methods in L<RT::Scrip>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 Table

Returns table name for records of this class.

=cut

sub Table {'ObjectScrips'}

=head2 ObjectCollectionClass

Returns class name of collection of records scrips can be added to.
Now it's only L<RT::Queue>, so 'RT::Queues' is returned.

=cut

sub ObjectCollectionClass {'RT::Queues'}

=head2 ScripObj

Returns the Scrip Object which has the id returned by Scrip

=cut

sub ScripObj {
    my $self = shift;
    my $id = shift || $self->Scrip;
    my $obj = RT::Scrip->new( $self->CurrentUser );
    $obj->Load( $id );
    return $obj;
}

=head2 Neighbors

Stage splits scrips into neighborhoods. See L<RT::Record::AddAndSort/Neighbors and Siblings>.

=cut

sub Neighbors {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = @_;

    my $res = $self->CollectionClass->new( $self->CurrentUser );
    $res->Limit( FIELD => 'Stage', VALUE => $args{'Stage'} || $self->Stage );
    return $res;
}

=head2 id

Returns the current value of id.
(In the database, id is stored as int(11).)


=cut


=head2 Scrip

Returns the current value of Scrip.
(In the database, Scrip is stored as int(11).)

=head2 FriendlyStage

Returns a localized human-readable version of the stage.

=cut

sub FriendlyStage {
    my $self = shift;
    my $scrip_class = blessed($self->ScripObj);
    return $scrip_class->FriendlyStage($self->Stage);
}

=head2 SetScrip VALUE


Set Scrip to VALUE.
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, Scrip will be stored as a int(11).)

=head2 Stage

Returns the current value of Stage.
(In the database, Stage is stored as varchar(32).)

=head2 SetStage VALUE

Set Stage to VALUE.
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, Stage will be stored as a varchar(32).)

=head2 ObjectId

Returns the current value of ObjectId.
(In the database, ObjectId is stored as int(11).)



=head2 SetObjectId VALUE


Set ObjectId to VALUE.
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, ObjectId will be stored as a int(11).)


=cut


=head2 SortOrder

Returns the current value of SortOrder.
(In the database, SortOrder is stored as int(11).)



=head2 SetSortOrder VALUE


Set SortOrder to VALUE.
Returns (1, 'Status message') on success and (0, 'Error Message') on failure.
(In the database, SortOrder will be stored as a int(11).)


=cut


=head2 Creator

Returns the current value of Creator.
(In the database, Creator is stored as int(11).)


=cut


=head2 Created

Returns the current value of Created.
(In the database, Created is stored as datetime.)


=cut


=head2 LastUpdatedBy

Returns the current value of LastUpdatedBy.
(In the database, LastUpdatedBy is stored as int(11).)


=cut


=head2 LastUpdated

Returns the current value of LastUpdated.
(In the database, LastUpdated is stored as datetime.)


=cut
