=head1 METHODS

Returns a user-readable description of what this group is for and what it's named.

=cut

    my $self = shift;
    if ($self->Domain eq 'ACLEquivalence') {
        my $user = RT::Principal->new($self->CurrentUser);

    }
    elsif ($self->RoleClass) {
        my $class = lc $self->RoleClass;
           $class =~ s/^RT:://i;
        return $self->loc("[_1] #[_2] [_3]", $self->loc($class), $self->Instance, $self->Name);

    }
    else {
        return $self->loc("undescribed group [_1]",$self->Id);
    }
}



=head2 Load ID

Load a group object from the database. Takes a single argument.
If the argument is numerical, load by the column 'id'. Otherwise, 
complain and return.

=cut

sub Load {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $identifier = shift || return undef;

    if ( $identifier !~ /\D/ ) {
        $self->SUPER::LoadById($identifier);
    }
    else {
        $RT::Logger->crit("Group -> Load called with a bogus argument");
        return undef;
    }
}



=head2 LoadUserDefinedGroup NAME

Loads a system group from the database. The only argument is
the group's name.


=cut

sub LoadUserDefinedGroup {
    my $self       = shift;
    my $identifier = shift;

    if ( $identifier =~ /^\d+$/ ) {

            Name   => $identifier,
        );
    }
}



=head2 LoadACLEquivalenceGroup PRINCIPAL

Loads a user's acl equivalence group. Takes a principal object or its ID.
ACL equivalnce groups are used to simplify the acl system. Each user
has one group that only he is a member of. Rights granted to the user
are actually granted to that group. This greatly simplifies ACL checks.
While this results in a somewhat more complex setup when creating users
and granting ACLs, it _greatly_ simplifies acl checks.

        Name     => 'UserEquiv',
        Instance => $principal,
    );
}




=head2 LoadSystemInternalGroup NAME

Loads a Pseudo group from the database. The only argument is
the group's name.

group for said object.

=head2 CreateRoleGroup

A convenience method for creating a role group on an object.

This method expects to be called from B<inside of a database transaction>!  If
you're calling it outside of one, you B<MUST> pass a false value for
InsideTransaction.

Takes a paramhash of:

=over 4

=item Name

Required.  RT's core role types are C<Requestor>, C<Cc>, C<AdminCc>, and
C<Owner>.  Extensions may add their own.

=item Object

Optional.  The object on which this role applies, used to set Domain and
Instance automatically.

=item Domain

Optional.  The class on which this role applies, with C<-Role> appended.  RT's
supported core role group domains are C<RT::Ticket-Role>, C<RT::Queue-Role>,
and C<RT::System-Role>.

Not required if you pass an Object.

=item Instance

Optional.  The numeric ID of the object (of the class encoded in Domain) on
which this role applies.  If Domain is C<RT::System-Role>, Instance should be C<1>.

Not required if you pass an Object.

=item InsideTransaction

Optional.  Defaults to true in expectation of usual call sites.  If you call
this method while not inside a transaction, you C<MUST> pass a false value for
this parameter.

=back

You must pass either an Object or both Domain and Instance.

Returns a tuple of (id, Message).  If id is false, the create failed and
Message should contain an error string.
