=head1 NAME

RT::Authen::Token - token-based authentication

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Allow for users to generate and login with authentication tokens. Users
with the C<ManageAuthTokens> permission will see a new "Auth Tokens"
menu item under "Logged in as ____" -> Settings. On that page they will
be able to generate new tokens and modify or revoke existing tokens.

Once you have an authentication token, you may use it in place of a
password to log into RT. (Additionally, L<REST2> allows for using auth
tokens with the C<Authorization: token> HTTP header.) One common use
case is to use an authentication token as an application-specific
password, so that you may revoke that application's access without
disturbing other applications. You also need not change your password,
since the application never received it.

If you have the C<AdminUsers> permission, along with
C<ManageAuthTokens>, you may generate, modify, and revoke tokens for
other users as well by visiting Admin -> Users -> Select -> (user) ->
Auth Tokens.

Authentication tokens are stored securely (hashed and salted) in the
database just like passwords, and so cannot be recovered after they are
generated.

=head2 Expires Date

An optional Expires Date may be entered when creating an authentication
token. If an authentication token has an Expires Date it will stop
working after that date.

Run the L<rt-email-expiring-auth-tokens> script to email users that have
expiring auth tokens.

=head2 Update your Apache configuration

If you are running RT under Apache, add the following directive to your RT
Apache configuration to allow RT to access the Authorization header.

    SetEnvIf Authorization "(.*)" HTTP_AUTHORIZATION=$1
