RT::Authen::ExternalAuth::LDAP - LDAP source for RT authentication

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides the LDAP implementation for L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth>.

            },
        },
    } );

=head1 CONFIGURATION

LDAP-specific options are described here. Shared options
are described in L<RT::Authen::ExternalAuth>.

The example in the L</SYNOPSIS> lists all available options
and they are described below. Note that many of these values
are specific to LDAP, so you should consult your LDAP
documentation for details.

=over 4

=item server

The server hosting the LDAP or AD service.

=item user, pass

The username and password RT should use to connect to the LDAP
server.

If you can bind to your LDAP server anonymously you may be able to omit these
options.  Many servers do not allow anonymous binds, or restrict what information
they can see or how much information they can retrieve.  If your server does not
allow anonymous binds then you must have a service account created for this
component to function.

=item base

The LDAP search base.

=item filter

The filter to use to match RT users. You B<must> specify it
and it B<must> be a valid LDAP filter encased in parentheses.

For example:

    filter => '(objectClass=*)',

=item d_filter

The filter that will only match disabled users. Optional.
B<Must> be a valid LDAP filter encased in parentheses.

For example with Active Directory the following can be used:

    d_filter => '(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=2)'

=item group

Does authentication depend on group membership? What group name?

=item group_attr

What is the attribute for the group object that determines membership?

=item group_scope

What is the scope of the group search? C<base>, C<one> or C<sub>.
Optional; defaults to C<base>, which is good enough for most cases.
C<sub> is appropriate when you have nested groups.

=item group_attr_value

What is the attribute of the user entry that should be matched against
group_attr above? Optional; defaults to C<dn>.

=item tls

Should we try to use TLS to encrypt connections?  Either a scalar, for
simple enabling, or a hash of values to pass to L<Net::LDAP/start_tls>.
By default, L<Net::LDAP> does B<no> certificate validation!  To validate
certificates, you must pass a hash with the C<verify> option set, along
with either C<capath> or C<cafile>.

C<capath> is a directory that contains certificates named using the hash
value of the certificates' subject names. On Debian-based distributions, the
C<ca-certificates> package manages a directory C</etc/ssl/certs>
suitable for this purpose (see L<Debian documentation|https://sources.debian.org/src/ca-certificates/latest/debian/README.Debian/>).
You can validate against public certificate authorities by passing:

    tls => { verify => 'require', capath => "/etc/ssl/certs" },

On Red Hat-based distributions, the C<ca-certificates> package manages a
directory C</etc/pki/tls/certs> suitable for this purpose
(see L<RedHat documentation|https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/ca-certificates-cli>).
You can validate against public certificate authorities by passing:

    tls => { verify => 'require', capath => "/etc/pki/tls/certs" },

If you don't have this directory set up, or if you want to validate the
LDAP server certificate against a specific certificate authority, you can
pass the path to one public certificate in the C<cafile> option:

    tls => { verify => 'require', cafile => "/etc/YourCACertPath.pem" },

=item net_ldap_args

What other args should be passed to Net::LDAP->new($host,@args)?
