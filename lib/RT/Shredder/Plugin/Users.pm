=head1 NAME

RT::Shredder::Plugin::Users - search plugin for wiping users.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=head2 status - string

Status argument allow you to limit result set to C<disabled>,
C<enabled> or C<any> users.
B<< Default value is C<disabled>. >>

=head2 name - mask

User name mask.

=head2 email - mask

Email address mask.

=head2 member_of - group identifier

Using this option users that are members of a particular group can
be selected for deletion. Identifier is name of user defined group
or id of a group, as well C<Privileged> or <unprivileged> can used
to select people from system groups.

=head2 not_member_of - group identifier

Like member_of, but selects users who are not members of the provided
group.

=head2 replace_relations - user identifier

When you delete a user there could be minor links to them in the RT database.
This option allow you to replace these links with links to the new user.
The replaceable links are Creator and LastUpdatedBy, but NOT any watcher roles.
This means that if the user is a watcher(Requestor, Owner,
Cc or AdminCc) of the ticket or queue then the link would be deleted.

This argument could be a user id or name.

=head2 no_tickets - boolean

If true then plugin looks for users who are not watchers (Owners,
Requestors, Ccs or AdminCcs) of any ticket.

Before RT 3.8.5, users who were watchers of deleted tickets B<will be deleted>
when this option was enabled. Decision has been made that it's not correct
and you should either shred these deleted tickets, change watchers or
explicitly delete user by name or email.

Note that found users still B<may have relations> with other objects,
for example via Creator or LastUpdatedBy fields, and you most probably
want to use C<replace_relations> option.

=head2 no_ticket_transactions - boolean

If true then plugin looks for users who have created no ticket transactions.
This is especially useful after wiping out tickets.

Note that found users still B<may have relations> with other objects,
for example via Creator or LastUpdatedBy fields, and you most probably
want to use C<replace_relations> option.
