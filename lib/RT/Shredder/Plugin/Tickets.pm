=head1 NAME

RT::Shredder::Plugin::Tickets - search plugin for wiping tickets.

=head1 ARGUMENTS

=head2 query - query string

Search tickets with query string.
Examples:
  Queue = 'my queue' AND ( Status = 'deleted' OR Status = 'rejected' )
  LastUpdated < '2003-12-31 23:59:59'

B<Hint:> You can construct query with the query builder in RT's web
interface and then open advanced page and copy query string.

Arguments C<queue>, C<status> and C<updated_before> have been dropped
as you can easy make the same search with the C<query> option.
See examples above.

=head2 with_linked - boolen

Deletes all tickets that are linked to tickets that match L<query>.

=head2 apply_query_to_linked - boolean

Delete linked tickets only if those too match L<query>.

See also L<with_linked>.
