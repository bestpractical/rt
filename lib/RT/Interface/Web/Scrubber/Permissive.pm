=head1 NAME

RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber::Permissive

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber. As a permissive version,
it's more suitable for trusted content. It permits nearly all items allowed
in HTML body except <script>, <style> and comments by default.

=head1 VARIABLES

These variables can be altered by creating a C<Permissive_Local.pm> file,
containing something of the form:

    package RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber::Permissive;

    # Deny the "style" attribute
    $ATTRIBUTES{style} = 0;

=over

=item C<@DENIED_TAGS>

Passed to L<HTML::Scrubber/deny>.

=item C<%ATTRIBUTES>

Passed into L<HTML::Scrubber/default>.

=item C<%RULES>

Passed to L<HTML::Scrubber/rules>.

=back

=cut

our @DENIED_TAGS;

# Initally from PermissiveHTMLMail extension.
our %ATTRIBUTES = (
    '*'    => 1,
    'href' => qr{^(?!(?:java)?script)}i,
    'src'  => qr{^(?!(?:java)?script)}i,
    'cite' => qr{^(?!(?:java)?script)}i,
    (
        map { +( "on$_" => 0 ) }
            qw/blur change click dblclick error focus
            keydown keypress keyup load mousedown
            mousemove mouseout mouseover mouseup reset
            select submit unload/
    ),
);

our %RULES = (
    script => 0,
    html   => 0,
    head   => 0,
    body   => 0,
    meta   => 0,
    base   => 0,
);

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Returns a new L<RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber::Permissive> object, configured
with the above globals. Takes no arguments.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self  = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

    $self->default( 1, \%ATTRIBUTES );
    $self->deny(@DENIED_TAGS);
    $self->rules(%RULES);

    # Scrubbing comments is vital since IE conditional comments can contain
    # arbitrary HTML and we'd pass it right on through.
    $self->comment(0);

    return $self;
