    RT::Interface::Web::ReportsRegistry - helper functions for reports

=cut

our $registry = {
    resolvedbyowner => {
        id    => 'resolvedbyowner',

=head2 Reports

Returns a list (array ref) of all registered reports. Reports are sorted by title.
Every element is a hash ref with the following keys:

=over 4

=item id - unique string identifier

=item title - human-readable title

=item path - path to the report relative to the root

=back

=cut

sub Reports {
    my @res
        = sort { lc( $a->{title} ) cmp lc( $b->{title} ) } values %$registry;
    return \@res;
}

=head2 Register

Registers a report that can be added to the Reports menu.

    use RT::Interface::Web::ReportsRegistry;
    RT::Interface::Web::ReportsRegistry->Register(
        id    => 'my_super_report',
        title => 'Super report',
        path  => 'MySuperReport.html',
    );

All reports are expected to be in the /Reports/ directory.

B<Note> that using existing id will overwrite the record in the registry.

=cut

sub Register {
    my $self = shift;
    my %args = (
        id    => undef,
        title => undef,
        path  => undef,
        @_
    );
    die "id is required" unless $args{id};

    $registry->{ $args{id} } = {
        id    => $args{id},
        title => $args{title},
        path  => '/Reports/' . $args{path},
    };
