=head2 callback

Takes hash with optional C<CallbackPage>, C<CallbackName>
and C<CallbackOnce> arguments, other arguments are passed
throught to callback components.

=over 4

=item CallbackPage

Page path relative to the root, leading slash is mandatory.
By default is equal to path of the caller component.

=item CallbackName

Name of the callback. C<Default> is used unless specified.

=item CallbackOnce

By default is false, otherwise runs callbacks only once per
process of the server. Such callbacks can be used to fill
structures.

=back

Searches for callback components in
F<< /Callbacks/<any dir>/CallbackPage/CallbackName >>, for
example F</Callbacks/MyExtension/autohandler/Default> would
be called as default callback for F</autohandler>.

=head2 request_path

Returns path of the request.

Very close to C<< $m->request_comp->path >>, but if called in a dhandler returns
path of the request without dhandler name, but with dhandler arguments instead.

    substr($path, -length $dh_name) = $self->dhandler_arg;
    return $path;
}

=head2 abort

Logs any recorded SQL statements for this request before calling the standard
abort.

=cut

sub abort {
    my $self = shift;
