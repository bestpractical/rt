=head1 NAME

RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a subclass of L<HTML::Scrubber> which automatically configures
itself with a sane and safe default set of rules.  Additionally, it
ensures that the input is balanced HTML by use of the L<HTML::Gumbo>
on the input to L</scrub>.

=head1 VARIABLES

These variables can be altered by creating a C<Scrubber_Local.pm>
file, containing something of the form:

    package RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber;

    # Allow the "title" attribute
    $ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES{title} = 1;

=over

=item C<@ALLOWED_TAGS>

Passed to L<HTML::Scrubber/allow>.

=item C<%ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES>

Passed into L<HTML::Scrubber/default>.

=item C<%RULES>

Passed to L<HTML::Scrubber/rules>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Returns a new L<RT::Interface::Web::Scrubber> object, configured with
the above globals.  Takes no arguments.

=cut

sub new {
    my $class = shift;
    my $self = $class->SUPER::new(@_);

    $self->default(
        0,
        {
            %ALLOWED_ATTRIBUTES,
            '*' => 0, # require attributes be explicitly allowed
        },
    );
    $self->deny(qw[*]);
    $self->allow(@ALLOWED_TAGS);

    # If $RULES{'img'} is pre-defined by custom code, we shouldn't touch it. If
    # it's not pre-defined, img rules could be different depending on configs,
    # which can be dynamically changed from web UI. Via a local version, we can
    # update it without worrying about affecting the pre-defined value.
    local $RULES{img} unless $RULES{img};

    # If we're displaying images, let embedded ones through
    if ( !$RULES{'img'} && ( RT->Config->Get('ShowTransactionImages') or RT->Config->Get('ShowRemoteImages') ) ) {

    # Scrubbing comments is vital since IE conditional comments can contain
    # arbitrary HTML and we'd pass it right on through.
    $self->comment(0);

}

=head2 gumbo

Returns a L<HTML::Gumbo> object.

=cut

sub gumbo {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->{_gumbo} //= HTML::Gumbo->new;
}

=head2 scrub TEXT

Takes a string of HTML, and returns it scrubbed, via L<HTML::Gumbo>
then the rules.  This is a more limited interface than
L<HTML::Scrubber/scrub>.

Accepts a second boolean argument to optionally skip the initial
L<HTML::Gumbo> check. Pass 1 (true) to skip this check. The
default is false.

=cut

sub scrub {
    my $self = shift;
    my $Content = shift // '';
    my $skip_structure_check = shift // 0;

    # Some strings come from trusted sources so that we can be sure that they
    # don't contain the types of tags that need to be checked for being
    # balanced.  Further, some of these strings (specifically format strings
    # for table output) may contain "unnecessary" HTML entities, such as &#39;,
    # that need to remain as-is for other reasons, but HTML::Gumbo converts
    # them to their "normal" form, such as '. This can cause display errors,
    # so we have an option to skip the check with HTML::Gumbo.

    unless ( $skip_structure_check ) {
        # First pass through HTML::Gumbo to balance the tags
        eval { $Content = $self->gumbo->parse( $Content ); chomp $Content };
        warn "HTML::Gumbo pre-parse failed: $@" if $@;
    }
