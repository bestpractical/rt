=head1 NAME

RT::Interface::Email::Action::Take - Take tickets via the mail gateway

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This plugin, if placed in L<RT_Config/@MailPlugins>, allows the mail
gateway to specify a take action:

    | rt-mailgate --action take-correspond --queue General --url http://localhost

This can alternately (and more flexibly) be accomplished with a Scrip.
