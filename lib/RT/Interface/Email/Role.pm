=head1 NAME

RT::Interface::Email::Role - Role for mail plugins

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package RT::Interface::Email::Action::Something;

    use Role::Basic 'with';
    with 'RT::Interface::Email::Role';

    sub CheckACL { ... }
    sub HandleSomething { ... }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a means to affect the handling of RT's mail gateway.  Mail
plugins (which appear in L<RT_Config/@MailPlugins> should implement this
role.

See F<docs/extending/mail_plugins.pod> for a list of hook points which
plugins can implement.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 TMPFAIL

This should be called for configuration errors.  It results in a
temporary failure code to the MTA, ensuring that the message is not
lost, and will be retried later.

This function should be passed the warning message to log with the
temporary failure.  Does not return.


=head2 FAILURE

This should be used upon rejection of a message.  It will B<not> be
retried by the MTA; as such, it should be used sparingly, and in
conjunction with L</MailError> such that the sender is aware of the
failure.

The function should be passed a message to return to the mailgate.  Does
not return.


=head2 SUCCESS

The message was successfully parsed.  The function takes an optional
L<RT::Ticket> object to return to the mailgate. Does not return.


=head2 MailError

Sends an error concerning the email, or the processing thereof.  Takes
the following arguments:

=over

=item To

Only necessary in L</BeforeDecode> and L<BeforeDecrypt> hooks, where it
defaults to L<RT_Config/OwnerEmail>; otherwise, defaults to the
originator of the message.

=item Subject

Subject of the email

=item Explanation

The body of the email

=item FAILURE

If passed a true value, will call L</FAILURE> after sending the message.
