=head2 Table

Returns name of the table where records are stored.

=cut

sub Table { 'CustomRoles'}

sub _Init {
    my $self = shift;

    $self->{'with_disabled_column'} = 1;

    return ( $self->SUPER::_Init(@_) );
}

sub _ObjectCustomRoleAlias {
    my $self = shift;
    return RT::ObjectCustomRoles->new( $self->CurrentUser )
        ->JoinTargetToThis( $self => @_ );
}

=head2 RegisterRoles

This declares all (enabled) custom roles to the L<RT::Record::Role::Roles>
subsystem, suitable for system startup.

=cut

sub RegisterRoles {
    my $class = shift;

    my $roles = $class->new(RT->SystemUser);
    $roles->UnLimit;

    while (my $role = $roles->Next) {
        $role->_RegisterAsRole;
    }
}

=head2 LimitToObjectId

Takes an ObjectId and limits the collection to custom roles applied to said object.

When called multiple times the ObjectId limits are joined with OR.

=cut

sub LimitToObjectId {
    my $self = shift;
    my $id = shift;
    $self->Limit(
        ALIAS           => $self->_ObjectCustomRoleAlias,
        FIELD           => 'ObjectId',
        OPERATOR        => '=',
        VALUE           => $id,
        ENTRYAGGREGATOR => 'OR'
    );
}

=head2 LimitToSingleValue

Limits the list of custom roles to only those that take a single value.

=cut

sub LimitToSingleValue {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->Limit(
        FIELD    => 'MaxValues',
        OPERATOR => '=',
        VALUE    => 1,
    );
}

=head2 LimitToMultipleValue

Limits the list of custom roles to only those that take multiple values.

=cut

sub LimitToMultipleValue {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->Limit(
        FIELD    => 'MaxValues',
        OPERATOR => '=',
        VALUE    => 0,
    );
}

=head2 ApplySortOrder

Sort custom roles according to the order provided by the object custom roles.

=cut

sub ApplySortOrder {
    my $self = shift;
    my $order = shift || 'ASC';
    $self->OrderByCols( {
        ALIAS => $self->_ObjectCustomRoleAlias,
        FIELD => 'SortOrder',
        ORDER => $order,
    } );
}

=head2 LimitToNotAdded

Takes either list of object ids or nothing. Limits collection
to custom roles to listed objects or any corespondingly.

=cut

sub LimitToNotAdded {
    my $self = shift;
    return RT::ObjectCustomRoles->new( $self->CurrentUser )->LimitTargetToNotAdded( $self => @_ );
}

=head2 LimitToAdded

Limits collection to custom roles to listed objects or any corespondingly.

=cut

sub LimitToAdded {
    my $self = shift;
    return RT::ObjectCustomRoles->new( $self->CurrentUser )->LimitTargetToAdded( $self => @_ );
}
