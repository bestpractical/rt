=head1 NAME

RT::Initialdata::JSON - Support for JSON-format initialdata files

=head1 DESCRIPTION

RT supports pluggable parsers for initialdata in different source
formats. This module supports JSON.

Perl-based initialdata files can contain not just data, but also
Perl code that executes when they are processed. The JSON format
is purely for data serialization and does not support code sections.

Files used with this handler must be UTF-8 encoded text containing a valid
JSON structure. See http://json.org for JSON syntax specifications.

=cut

package RT::Initialdata::JSON;

use strict;
use warnings;

use JSON;

=head2 C<CanLoad($json)>

This is called by base RT to determine if an initialdata file is whatever type
is associated with this module. It must return true or false. Takes one arg,
the content of the file to check.

=cut

sub CanLoad {
    my $self = shift;
    my $json = shift;
    return 0 unless $json;

    my $parsed;
    eval { $parsed = JSON->new->decode($json) };
    return 0 if ($@);
    return 1;
}


=head2 C<Load($data, \@Var, ...)>

This is the main routine called when initialdata file handlers are enabled. It
is passed the file contents and refs to the arrays that will be populated from
the file. If the file parsing fails, due to invalid JSON (generally indicating
that the file is actually a Perl initialdata file), the sub will return false.

=cut

sub Load {
    my ($self, $json, $vars) = @_;
    return 0 unless $json;

    my $parsed;
    eval { $parsed = JSON->new->decode($json) };
    if ($@) {
        RT::Logger->debug("Could not parse initialdata as JSON: ($@)");
        return 0;
    }

    RT::Logger->info("JSON initialdata has unsupported 'Initial' or 'Final'; ignoring.")
        if ($parsed->{Initial} or $parsed->{Final});

    foreach (keys %$vars) {
        # Explicitly skip Initial and Final, because we don't want any code or
        # data that will be eval'd like these keys will be.
        next if /Initial/ or /Final/;
        next unless $parsed->{$_};
        die "JSON initialdata error: The key named $_ must have a value of type array, but does not."
            unless ref $parsed->{$_} eq 'ARRAY';
        no strict 'refs';
        @{$vars->{$_}} =  @{$parsed->{$_}};
    }

    return 1;
}
