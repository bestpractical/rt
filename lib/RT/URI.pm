=head1 NAME

RT::URI

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class provides a base class for URIs, such as those handled
by RT::Link objects.  

=head1 API



=cut




=head2 new

Create a new RT::URI object.

=cut

                         
sub new {
    my $proto = shift;
    my $class = ref($proto) || $proto;
    my $self  = {};
    bless( $self, $class );

    $self->CurrentUser(@_);

    return ($self);
}

=head2 CanonicalizeURI <URI>

Returns the canonical form of the given URI by calling L</FromURI> and then L</URI>.

If the URI is unparseable by FromURI the passed in URI is simply returned untouched.

=cut

sub CanonicalizeURI {
    my $self = shift;
    my $uri  = shift;
    if ($self->FromURI($uri)) {
        my $canonical = $self->URI;
        if ($canonical and $uri ne $canonical) {
            RT->Logger->debug("Canonicalizing URI '$uri' to '$canonical'");
            $uri = $canonical;
        }
    }
    return $uri;
}


=head2 FromObject <Object>

Given a local object, such as an RT::Ticket or an RT::Article, this routine will return a URI for
the local object

=cut

sub FromObject {
    my $self = shift;
    my $obj = shift;

    return undef unless  $obj->can('URI');
    return $self->FromURI($obj->URI);
}



=head2 FromURI <URI>

Returns a local object id for this content. You are expected to know
what sort of object this is the Id of

Returns true if everything is ok, otherwise false

=cut

sub FromURI {
    my $self = shift;
    my $uri = shift;

    return undef unless ($uri);

    my $scheme;
    # Special case: integers passed in as URIs must be ticket ids
    if ($uri =~ /^(\d+)$/) {
        $scheme = "fsck.com-rt";
    } elsif ($uri =~ /^((?!javascript|data)(?:\w|\.|-)+?):/i) {
        $scheme = $1;
    }
    else {
        $self->{resolver} = RT::URI::base->new( $self->CurrentUser ); # clear resolver
        $RT::Logger->warning("Could not determine a URI scheme for $uri");
        return (undef);
    }

    # load up a resolver object for this scheme
    $self->_GetResolver($scheme);

    unless ($self->Resolver->ParseURI($uri)) {
        $RT::Logger->warning( "Resolver "
              . ref( $self->Resolver )
              . " could not parse $uri, maybe Organization config was changed?"
        );
        $self->{resolver} = RT::URI::base->new( $self->CurrentUser ); # clear resolver
        return (undef);
    }

    return(1);

}



=head2 _GetResolver <scheme>

Gets an RT URI resolver for the scheme <scheme>. 
Falls back to a null resolver. RT::URI::base.

=cut

sub _GetResolver {
    my $self = shift;
    my $scheme = shift;

    $scheme =~ s/(\.|-)/_/g;
    my $resolver;

    
    eval " 
        require RT::URI::$scheme;
        \$resolver = RT::URI::$scheme->new(\$self->CurrentUser);
    ";
     
    if ($resolver) {
        $self->{'resolver'} = $resolver;
    } else {
        RT->Logger->warning("Failed to create new resolver object for scheme '$scheme': $@")
            if $@ !~ m{Can't locate RT/URI/\Q$scheme\E};
        $self->{'resolver'} = RT::URI::base->new($self->CurrentUser); 
    }

}



=head2 Scheme

Returns a local object id for this content.  You are expected to know
what sort of object this is the Id of

=cut

sub Scheme {
    my $self = shift;
    return ($self->Resolver->Scheme);

}

=head2 URI

Returns a local object id for this content.  You are expected to know what sort of object this is the Id 
of 

=cut

sub URI {
    my $self = shift;
    return ($self->Resolver->URI);

}


=head2 Object

Returns a local object for this content. This will usually be an RT::Ticket or somesuch

=cut


sub Object {   
    my $self = shift;
    return($self->Resolver->Object);

}




=head2 IsLocal

Returns a local object for this content. This will usually be an RT::Ticket or somesuch

=cut

sub IsLocal {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->Resolver->IsLocal;     
}



=head2 AsHREF


=cut


sub AsHREF {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->Resolver->HREF;
}

=head2 Resolver

Returns this URI's URI resolver object

=cut


sub Resolver {
    my $self =shift;
    return ($self->{'resolver'});
}

=head2 AsString

Returns a friendly display form of the object if Local, or the full URI

=cut

sub AsString {
    my $self = shift;
    return $self->Resolver->AsString;
}

RT::Base->_ImportOverlays();
