BUGS
=====

 * Don't show articles twice. If we find an article by matching on the
   Title/Summary we should skip it if we also find it by matching in the
   Custom Fields - falcone

   articles are found - falcone

 * If creation fails because of link creation, $ArticleObj->Id will be non-
   zero, as it *did* have a row in the article table -- even though it was
   rolled back. Forcing $ArticleObj to be fresh avoids a bug with
   EditCustomFields thinking the article actually existed, and hence not
   having a sticky value. - alexmv

 * Um, '=' != '0'; MySQL loves me too much, and let me get away with it -
   alexmv
